Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder
*******************************************

*Taleb, Nassim Nicholas*  (4294968430)

* a simple test of asymmetry: anything that has more upside than downside from random events (or certain shocks) is antifragile; the reverse is fragile.
* complex systems are weakened, even killed, when deprived of stressors
* Thou shalt not have antifragility at the expense of the fragility of others.
* Life is more, a lot more, labyrinthine than shown in our memory—our minds are in the business of turning history into something smooth and linear
* Nonlinear” means that when you double the dose of, say, a medication, or when you double the number of employees in a factory, you don’t get twice the initial effect, but rather a lot more or a lot less.
* We can detect fragility, see it, even in many cases measure it, or at least measure comparative fragility with a small error while comparisons of risk have been (so far) unreliable
* he tends to mistake the unknown for the nonexistent.
* In short, the fragilista (medical, economic, social planning) is one who makes you engage in policies and actions, all artificial, in which the benefits are small and visible, and the side effects potentially severe and invisible.
* Less is more and usually more effective
* But simplicity is not so simple to attain. Steve Jobs figured out that “you have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple.” The Arabs have an expression for trenchant prose: no skill to understand it, mastery to write it.
* everything that does not like volatility does not like stressors, harm, chaos, events, disorder, “unforeseen” consequences, uncertainty, and, critically, time.
* Further, in writing, I feel corrupt and unethical if I have to look up a subject in a library as part of the writing itself. This acts as a filter—it is the only filter.
* Modernity has replaced ethics with legalese, and the law can be gamed with a good lawyer
* First ethical rule:If you see fraud and do not say fraud, you are a fraud.
* Compromising is condoning.
* I grew to find people greedy for credentials nauseating, repulsive, and untrustworthy.
* he fragile wants tranquility, the antifragile grows from disorder, and the robust doesn’t care too much
* Humans somehow fail to recognize situations outside the contexts in which they usually learn about them.
* Layers of redundancy are the central risk management property of natural systems
* Lucretius problem
* the tallest mountain in the world will be equal to the tallest one he has observed
* the more energy you put into trying to control your ideas and what you think about, the more your ideas end up controlling you.
* Information is antifragile; it feeds more on attempts to harm it than it does on efforts to promote it.
* fire feeds on obstacles.”
* hen you don’t have debt you don’t care about your reputation in economics circles
* It is quite perplexing that those from whom we have benefited the most aren’t those who have tried to help us (say with “advice”) but rather those who have actively tried—but eventually failed—to harm us.
* We just cannot isolate any causal relationship in a complex system
* Humans tend to do better with acute than with chronic stressors, particularly when the former are followed by ample time for recovery, which allows the stressors to do their jobs as messengers.
* If I could predict what my day would exactly look like, I would feel a little bit dead
* life starts tasting like food cooked without salt.
* a severe logical mistake to present a tradeoff, to use unsavory aspects of early humanity as a necessary cost of avoiding modern tortures. There is no reason to not want advantages from both eras.
* you walk on uneven, not man-made terrain, no two steps will ever be identical—compare that to the randomness-free gym machine offering the exact opposite: forcing you into endless repetitions of the very same movement.Much of modern life is preventable chronic stress injury.
* Nature does not find its members very helpful after their reproductive abilities are depleted (except perhaps special situations in which animals live in groups, such as the need for grandmothers in the human and elephant domains to assist others in preparing offspring to take charge
* nature is opportunistic, ruthless, and selfish.
* If nature ran the economy, it would not continuously bail out its living members to make them live forever.
* Black Swan Management 101: nature (and nature-like systems) likes diversity between organisms rather than diversity within an immortal organism, unless you consider nature itself the immortal organism, as in the pantheism of Spinoza or that present in Asian religions, or the Stoicism of Chrisippus or Epictetus. If you run into a historian of civilizations, try to explain it to him.
* So evolution benefits from randomness by two different routes: randomness in the mutations, and randomness in the environment—both act in a similar way to cause changes in the traits of the surviving next generations.
* But note that evolution likes randomness only up to some limit.2 If a calamity completely kills life on the entire planet, the fittest will not survive. Likewise, if random mutations occur at too high a rate, then the fitness gain might not stick, might perhaps even reverse thanks to a new mutation: as I will keep repeating, nature is antifragile up to a point but such point is quite high—it can take a lot, a lot of shocks. Should a nuclear event eradicate most of life on earth, but not all life, some rat or bacteria will emerge out of nowhere, perhaps the bottom of the oceans, and the story will start again, without us, and without the members of the Office of Management and Budget, of course.
* From the outside, it looks like there is hormesis, but from the inside, there are winners and losers.
* the antifragility of the higher level may require the fragility—and sacrifice—of the lower one
* risk taking is healthy for the economy—under the condition that not all people take the same risks and that these risks remain small and localized.
* Now, by disrupting the model, as we will see, with bailouts, governments typically favor a certain class of firms that are large enough to require being saved in order to avoid contagion to other business. This is the opposite of healthy risk-taking; it is transferring fragility from the collective to the unfit. People have difficulty realizing that the solution is building a system in which nobody’s fall can drag others down—for continuous failures work to preserve the system. Paradoxically, many government interventions and social policies end up hurting the weak and consolidating the established.
* Nietzsche’s famous expression “what does not kill me makes me stronger” can be easily misinterpreted as meaning Mithridatization or hormesis. It may be one of these two phenomena, very possible, but it could as well mean “what did not kill me did not make me stronger, but spared me because I am stronger than others; but it killed others and the average population is now stronger because the weak are gone.” In other words, I passed an exit exam. I’ve discussed the problem in earlier writings of the false illusion of causality, with a newspaper article saying that the new mafia members, former Soviet exiles, had been “hardened by a visit to the Gulag” (the Soviet concentration camps). Since the sojourn in the Gulag killed the weakest, one had the illusion of strengthening. Sometimes we see people having survived trials and imagine, given that the surviving population is sturdier than the original one, that these trials are good for them. In other words, the trial can just be a ruthless exam that kills those who fail. All we may be witnessing is that transfer of fragility (rather, antifragility) from the individual to the system that I discussed earlier. Let me present it in a different way. The surviving cohort, clearly, is stronger than the initial one—but not quite the individuals, since the weaker ones died.
* Sacrifice for the sake of the group is behind the notion of heroism: it is good for the tribe, bad for those who perish under the fever of war.
* the first suicide bombers in the Levant were revolutionaries of Greek Orthodox background—my tribe—not Islamists.
* Man-made smoothing of randomness produces the equivalent of John’s income: smooth, steady, but fragile.
* We made the wrong mistake
* Nature loves small errors (without which genetic variations are impossible), humans don’t—hence when you rely on human judgment you are at the mercy of a mental bias that disfavors antifragility.
* a collection of small units with semi-independent variations produces vastly different risk characteristics than a single large unit.
* we have traditionally lived in small units and tribes and managed rather well in small units
* Eye contact with one’s peers changes one’s behavior.
* one is prone to be fooled by the properties of the past and get the story exactly backwards
* It is exactly like saying that nuclear bombs are safer because they explode less often.
* Light control works; close control leads to overreaction
* delaying crises is not a very good idea.
* The longer one goes without a market trauma, the worse the damage when commotion occurs.
* The idea of injecting random noise into a system to improve its functioning has been applied across fields. By a mechanism called stochastic resonance, adding random noise to the background makes you hear the sounds (say, music) with more accuracy. We saw earlier that the psychological effect of overcompensation helps us get signals in the midst of noise; here it is not psychological but a physical property of the system. Weak SOS signals, too weak to get picked up by remote receptors, can become audible in the presence of background noise and random interference. By adding to the signal, random hiss allows it to rise sufficiently above the threshold of detection to become audible—nothing in that situation does better than randomness, which comes for free.
* To summarize, the problem with artificially suppressed volatility is not just that the system tends to become extremely fragile; it is that, at the same time, it exhibits no visible risks. Also remember that volatility is information. In fact, these systems tend to be too calm and exhibit minimal variability as silent risks accumulate beneath the surface. Although the stated intention of political leaders and economic policy makers is to stabilize the system by inhibiting fluctuations, the result tends to be the opposite. These artificially constrained systems become prone to Black Swans. Such environments eventually experience massive blowups, of the type seen in Figure 3, catching everyone off guard and undoing years of stability or, in almost all cases, ending up far worse than they were in their initial volatile state. Indeed, the longer it takes for the blowup to occur, the worse the resulting harm to both economic and political systems.
* As a Christian, parts of Saudi Arabia are off-limits to me, as I would violate the purity of the place. But no public part of the United States or Western Europe is off-limits to Saudi citizens.
* One of life’s packages: no stability without volatility.
* There is a dependence on narratives, an intellectualization of actions and ventures. Public enterprises and functionaries—even employees of large corporations—can only do things that seem to fit some narrative, unlike businesses that can just follow profits, with or without a good-sounding story. Remember that you need a name for the color blue when you build a narrative, but not in action—the thinker lacking a word for “blue” is handicapped; not the doer. (I’ve had a hard time conveying to intellectuals the intellectual superiority of practice.)
* Modernity widened the difference between the sensational and the relevant
* For we have managed to transfer religious belief into gullibility for whatever can masquerade as scienc
* naive interventionism.
* It is generally accepted that harm from doctors—not including risks from hospital germs—accounts for more deaths than any single cancer.
* In the case of tonsillectomies, the harm to the children undergoing unnecessary treatment is coupled with the trumpeted gain for some others. The name for such net loss, the (usually hidden or delayed) damage from treatment in excess of the benefits, is iatrogenics, literally, “caused by the healer,” iatros being a healer in Greek. We will posit in Chapter 21 that every time you visit a doctor and get a treatment, you incur risks of such medical harm, which should be analyzed the way we analyze other trade-offs: probabilistic benefits minus probabilistic costs.
* People with an engineering-oriented mind will tend to look at everything around as an engineering problem
* During the cold war, the University of Chicago was promoting laissez-faire theories, while the University of Moscow taught the exact opposite—but their respective physics departments were in convergence, if not total agreement
* Experiments show that alertness is weakened when one relinquishes control to the system
* But one needs to be careful not to overgeneralize the Drachten effect,
* It’s much easier to sell “Look what I did for you” than “Look what I avoided for you.
* However, as always, the elders seem to have far more wisdom than we moderns—and much, much simpler wisdom
* There is a Latin expression festina lente, “make haste slowly.” The Romans were not the only ancients to respect the act of voluntary omission. The Chinese thinker Lao Tzu coined the doctrine of wu-wei, “passive achievement.”
* Since procrastination is a message from our natural willpower via low motivation, the cure is changing the environment, or one’s profession, by selecting one in which one does not have to fight one’s impulses.
* someone who procrastinates is not irrational; it is his environment that is irrational
* what is natural is not necessarily morally right
* The more frequently you look at data, the more noise you are disproportionally likely to get
* the best way to mitigate interventionism is to ration the supply of information, as naturalistically as possible
* the more data you get, the less you know what’s going on,
* predicting revolutions is not the same as counting cards; humans will never be able to turn politics and economics into the tractable randomness of blackjack.
* People are cruel and unfair in the way they confer recognition, so it is best to stay out of that game.
* You can’t predict in general, but you can predict that those who rely on predictions are taking more risks, will have some trouble, perhaps even go bust
* Success brings an asymmetry: you now have a lot more to lose than to gain. You are hence fragile
* Men feel the good less intensely than the bad”
* Seen this way, Stoicism is about the domestication, not necessarily the elimination, of emotions. It is not about turning humans into vegetables. My idea of the modern Stoic sage is someone who transforms fear into prudence, pain into information, mistakes into initiation, and desire into undertaking.
* You are antifragile for a source of volatility if potential gains exceed potential losses
* The first step toward antifragility consists in first decreasing downside, rather than increasing upside
* bimodal strategy (maximally safe plus maximally speculative)
* The Domestication of Uncertainty
* Do crazy things (break furniture once in a while), like the Greeks during the later stages of a drinking symposium, and stay “rational” in larger decisions. Trashy gossip magazines and classics or sophisticated works; never middlebrow stuff. Talk to either undergraduate students, cab drivers, and gardeners or the highest caliber scholars; never to middling-but-career-conscious academics. If you dislike someone, leave him alone or eliminate him; don’t attack him verbally.2
* just as Stoicism is the domestication, not the elimination, of emotions, so is the barbell a domestication, not the elimination, of uncertain
* This entire heritage of thinking, grounded in the sentence “An agent does not move except out of intention for an end,” is where the most pervasive human error lies, compounded by two or more centuries of the illusion of unconditional scientific understanding. This
* Optionality will take us many places, but at the core, an option is what makes you antifragile and allows you to benefit from the positive side of uncertainty, without a corresponding serious harm from the negative side.
* The formula in Chapter 10 was: antifragility equals more to gain than to lose equals more upside than downside equals asymmetry (unfavorable) equals likes volatility. And if you make more when you are right than you are hurt when you are wrong, then you will benefit, in the long run, from volatility (and the reverse). You are only harmed if you repeatedly pay too much for the option. But in this case Thales patently got a good deal—and we will see in the rest of Book IV that we don’t pay for the options given to us by nature and technological innovation. Financial options may be expensive because people know they are options and someone is selling them and charging a price—but most interesting options are free, or at the worst, cheap.
* Risk taking ain’t gambling, and optionality ain’t lottery tickets.
* the intellectual society rewards “difficult” derivations, compared to practice in which there is no penalty for simplicity
* But it took me a lifetime to figure out the second point: implementation does not necessarily proceed from invention. It, too, requires luck and circumstances
* the simpler and more obvious the discovery, the less equipped we are to figure it out by complicated methods
* Simplicity, I realized, does not lead to laurels.
* If the student is smart, the teacher takes the credit.”
* history belongs to those who can write about it (whether winners or losers
* We also make such corrections with commercial products, not overly trusting advertising.But we don’t correct for the difference in science, medicine, and mathematics, for the same reasons we didn’t pay attention to iatrogenics. We are suckers for the sophisticated.
* sophistication is born of need, and success of difficulties—
* Serious empirical investigation (largely thanks to one Lant Pritchet, then a World Bank economist) shows no evidence that raising the general level of education raises income at the level of a country.
* scholarship and organized education are not the same.
* Aside from the non-narrative view of things, another lesson. People with too much smoke and complicated tricks and methods in their brains start missing elementary, very elementary things
* Aside from the non-narrative view of things, another lesson. People with too much smoke and complicated tricks and methods in their brains start missing elementary, very elementary things. Persons in the real world can’t afford to miss these things; otherwise they crash the plane. Unlike researchers, they were selected for survival, not complications. So I saw the less is more in action: the more studies, the less obvious elementary but fundamental things become; activity, on the other hand, strips things to their simplest possible model.
* In theory there is no difference between theory and practice; in practice there is
* All this does not mean that tinkering and trial and error are devoid of narrative: they are just not overly dependent on the narrative being true—the narrative is not epistemological but instrumental. For instance, religious stories might have no value as narratives, but they may get you to do something convex and antifragile you otherwise would not do, like mitigate risks. English parents controlled children with the false narrative that if they didn’t behave or eat their dinner, Boney (Napoleon Bonaparte) or some wild animal might come and take them away. Religions often use the equivalent method to help adults get out of trouble, or avoid debt. But intellectuals tend to believe their own b\*\*\*t and take their ideas too literally, and that is vastly dangerous.
* An idea does not survive because it is better than the competition, but rather because the person who holds it has survived
* We showed earlier the evidence that classroom education does not lead to wealth as much as it comes from wealth (an epiphenomenon). Next let us see how, similarly, antifragile risk taking—not education and formal, organized research—is largely responsible for innovation and growth, while the story is dressed up by textbook writers. It does not mean that theories and research play no role; it is that just as we are fooled by randomness, so we are fooled into overestimating the role of good-sounding ideas. We will look at the confabulations committed by historians of economic thought, medicine, technology, and other fields that tend to systematically downgrade practitioners and fall into the green lumber fallacy.
* It does not mean that theories and research play no role; it is that just as we are fooled by randomness, so we are fooled into overestimating the role of good-sounding ideas.
* illusions of cause and effect
* No, we don’t put theories into practice. We create theories out of practice
* Scranton showed that we have been building and using jet engines in a completely trial-and-error experiential manner, without anyone truly understanding the theory. Builders needed the original engineers who knew how to twist things to make the engine work. Theory came later, in a lame way, to satisfy the intellectual bean counter. But that’s not what you tend to read in standard histories of technology: my son, who studies aerospace engineering, was not aware of this. Scranton was polite and focused on situations in which innovation is messy, “distinguished from more familiar analytic and synthetic innovation approaches,” as if the latter were the norm, which it is obviously not.
* we cannot reverse engineer the taste of food from looking at the nutritional label.
* Now, instead of looking into a scholar’s writings to see whether he is credible or not, it is always best to consider what his detractors say—they will uncover what’s worst in his argument. So I looked for the detractors of Kealey, or people opposing his ideas, to see if they address anything of merit—and to see where they come from. Aside from some comments by Joel Mokyr, who, as I said, has not yet discovered optionality, and an attack by an economist of the type that doesn’t count, given the devaluation of the currency of the economics profession, the main critique against Kealey, published in the influential journal Nature by a science bureaucrat, was that he uses data from government-sponsored agencies such as the OECD in his argument against tax-funded research. So far, no substantive evidence that Kealey was wrong. But, let us flip the burden of evidence: there is zero evidence that the opposite of his thesis is remotely right. Much of all of this is a religious belief in the unconditional power of organized science, one that has replaced unconditional religious belief in organized religion.
* to use the venture capitalist’s lingo, you bet on the jockey, not the horse
* studying the chemical composition of ingredients will make you neither a better cook nor a more expert taster—it might even make you worse at both.
* One can make a list of medications that came Black Swan–style from serendipity and compare it to the list of medications that came from design. I was about to embark on such a list until I realized that the notable exceptions, that is, drugs that were discovered in a teleological manner, are too few—mostly AZT, AIDS drugs. Designer drugs have a main property—they are designed (and are therefore teleological). But it does not look as if we are capable of designing a drug while taking into account the potential side effects. Hence a problem for the future of designer drugs. The more drugs there are on the market, the more interactions with one another—so we end up with a swelling number of possible interactions with every new drug introduced. If there are twenty unrelated drugs, the twenty-first would need to consider twenty interactions, no big deal. But if there are a thousand, we would need to predict a little less than a thousand. And there are tens of thousands of drugs available today. Further, there is research showing that we may be underestimating the interactions of current drugs, those already on the market, by a factor of four so, if anything, the pool of available drugs should be shrinking rather than growing.
* Matt Ridley’s Anti-Teleological Argument
* Almost everything theoretical in management, from Taylorism to all productivity stories, upon empirical testing, has been exposed as pseudoscience—and like most economic theories, lives in a world parallel to the evidence
* for the antifragile, good news tends to be absent from past data, and for the fragile it is the bad news that doesn’t show easily.
* Their experiences are often formalized by academics;
* history has been written by those who want you to believe that reasoning has a monopoly or near monopoly on the production of knowledge.
* the logical fallacy that if quacks are found among nonacademics, nonacademics are all quack
* It is not well advertised that there is no evidence that abilities in chess lead to better reasoning off the chessboard
* It is as if the mission of modernity was to squeeze every drop of variability and randomness out of life
* Lions in captivity live longer; they are technically richer, and they are guaranteed job security for life, if these are the criteria you are focusing on …
* The trick is to be bored with a specific book, rather than with the act of reading.
* much of what other people know isn’t worth knowing.”
* Indeed, the most severe mistake made in life is to mistake the unintelligible for the unintelligent
* But are we humans so fundamentally different as to be completely stripped of instinct leading us to do things we have no clue about?
* FAT TONY: “My dear Socrates … you know why they are putting you to death? It is because you make people feel stupid for blindly following habits, instincts, and traditions. You may be occasionally right. But you may confuse them about things they’ve been doing just fine without getting in trouble. You are destroying people’s illusions about themselves. You are taking the joy of ignorance out of the things we don’t understand. And you have no answer; you have no answer to offer them.”
* “What is not intelligible to me is not necessarily unintelligent” is perhaps the most potent sentence in all of Nietzsche’s century
* Perhaps there is a realm of wisdom from which the logician is exiled?
* growth in knowledge—or in anything—cannot proceed without the Dionysian
* structured learning likes the impoverishment and simplification of naive rationalism, easy to teach, not the rich texture of empiricism
* logic excludes—by definition—nuances, and since truth resides exclusively in the nuances, it is “a useless instrument for finding Truth in the moral and political sciences.”
* exposure is more important than knowledge
* decision effects supersede logic.
* For Tony, the distinction in life isn’t True or False, but rather sucker or nonsucker. Things are always simpler with him. In real life, as we saw with the ideas of Seneca and the bets of Thales, exposure is more important than knowledge; decision effects supersede logic. Textbook “knowledge” misses a dimension, the hidden asymmetry of benefits—just like the notion of average. The need to focus on the payoff from your actions instead of studying the structure of the world (or understanding the “True” and the “False”) has been largely missed in intellectual history. Horribly missed. The payoff, what happens to you (the benefits or harm from it), is always the most important thing, not the event itself.
* You decide principally based on fragility, not probabilit
* when a collection of people write “There is nothing new here” and each one cites a different originator of the idea, one can safely say there is something effectively new.
* Asymmetry is necessarily nonlinearity. More harm than benefits: simply, an increase in intensity brings more harm than a corresponding decrease offers benefits.
* For the fragile, the cumulative effect of small shocks is smaller than the single effect of an equivalent single large shock
* For the antifragile, shocks bring more benefits (equivalently, less harm) as their intensity increases (up to a point).
* Actually, by another rule of personal discipline I do not make appointments (other than lectures) except the very same morning, as a date on the calendar makes me feel like a prisoner, but that’s another story.
* This is the central problem of efficiency: these types of errors compound, multiply, swell, with an effect that only goes in one direction—the wrong direction.
* There appears to be something about size that is harmful to corporations.
* The gains from size are visible but the risks are hidden, and some concealed risks seem to bring frailties into the companies.
* Jared Diamond, always ahead of others, figured out such vulnerability in a paper called “Why Cats Have Nine Lives.”
* Clearly, the postmortem analyses were mistaken, attributing the problem to bad controls by the bad capitalistic system, and lack of vigilance on the part of the bank. It was not. Nor was it “greed,” a
* It is completely wrong to use the calculus of benefits without including the probability of failure.
* It so happens that contemporary economic optimized life causes us to build larger and larger theaters, but with the exact same door. They no longer make this mistake too often while building cinemas, theaters, and stadiums, but we tend to make the mistake in other domains, such as, for instance, natural resources and food supplies. Just consider that the price of wheat more than tripled in the years 2004–2007 in response to a small increase in net demand, around 1 percent.3
* The world is getting less and less predictable, and we rely more and more on technologies that have errors and interactions that are harder to estimate, let alone predict.
* And the information economy is the culprit
* This has led me to install a governmental golden rule: no borrowing allowed, forced fiscal balance.
* in August 2010, a computer error made the entire market crash (the “flash crash”);
* August 2012, as this manuscript was heading to the printer, the Knight Capital Group had its computer system go wild and cause $10 million dollars of losses a minute, losing $480 million.
* fragility (and antifragility) detection heuristic
* This one-sidedness brings both underestimation of randomness and underestimation of harm, since one is more exposed to harm than benefit from error
* Some forecasts are hurt by uncertainty—and, like travel time, one needs a buffer. Airlines figured out how to do it, but not governments, when they estimate deficits.
* The notion of average is of no significance when one is fragile to variations—
* Here, consider that, as much as a good simplification the notion of average can be, it can also be a Procrustean bed. The information that the average temperature is seventy degrees Fahrenheit does not simplify the situation for your grandmother. It is information squeezed into a Procrustean bed—and these are necessarily committed by scientific modelers, since a model is by its very nature a simplification. You just don’t want the simplification to distort the situation to the point of being harmful.
* charlatans are recognizable in that they will give you positive advice, and only positive advice,
* The greatest—and most robust—contribution to knowledge consists in removing what we think is wrong—subtractive epistemology.
* since one small observation can disprove a statement, while millions can hardly confirm it, disconfirmation is more rigorous than confirmation.
* in general, failure (and disconfirmation) are more informative than success and confirmation, which is why I claim that negative knowledge is just “more robust.”
* Almost everything contemporary has winner-take-all effects, which includes sources of harm and benefits.
* we have never had more data than we have now, yet have less predictability than ever.
* More data—such as paying attention to the eye colors of the people around when crossing the street—can make you miss the big truck
* I discovered that I had been intuitively using the less-is-more idea as an aid in decision making (contrary to the method of putting a series of pros and cons side by side on a computer screen). For instance, if you have more than one reason to do something (choose a doctor or veterinarian, hire a gardener or an employee, marry a person, go on a trip), just don’t do it. It does not mean that one reason is better than two, just that by invoking more than one reason you are trying to convince yourself to do something

It does not mean that one reason is better than two, just that by invoking more than one reason you are trying to convince yourself to do something. Obvious decisions (robust to error) require no more than a single reason. Likewise the French army had a heuristic to reject excuses for absenteeism for more than one reason, like death of grandmother, cold virus, and being bitten by a boar. If someone attacks a book or idea using more than one argument, you know it is not real: nobody says “he is a criminal, he killed many people, and he also has bad table manners and bad breath and is a very poor driver.”
* Bergson’s razor: “A philosopher should be known for one single idea, not more”
* So, a heuristic: if someone has a long bio, I skip him
* Antifragility implies—contrary to initial instinct—that the old is superior to the new, and much more than you think
* Antifragility implies—contrary to initial instinct—that the old is superior to the new, and much more than you think. No matter how something looks to your intellectual machinery, or how well or poorly it narrates, time will know more about its fragilities and break it when necessary. Here, I expose a contemporary disease—linked to interventionism—called neomania, which brings fragility but I believe may be treatable if one is patient enough.
* “Time has sharp teeth that destroy everything
* time burns but leaves no ashes
* time erases things, even bad memories (though it doesn’t say that it erases us as well in the process
* Recall that the most fragile is the predictive, what is built on the basis of predictability—in other words, those who underestimate Black Swans will eventually exit the population
* An interesting apparent paradox is that, according to these principles, longer-term predictions are more reliable than short-term ones
* given an interpolation of past developments. We also represent society according to our utopia of the moment, largely driven by our wishes—except for a few people called doomsayers, the future will be largely inhabited by our desires.
* textbook characteristics of nerdiness—mostly lack of charm, interest in objects instead of persons, causing them to neglect their looks. They love precision at the expense of applicability. And they typically share an absence of literary culture.
* the past—properly handled, as we will see in the next section—is a much better teacher about the properties of the future than the present.
* For the perishable, every additional day in its life translates into ashorteradditional life expectancy. For the nonperishable, every additional day may imply alongerlife expectancy.
* he who does not have a past has no future.6
* So with so many technologically driven and modernistic items—skis, cars, computers, computer programs—it seems that we notice differences between versions rather than commonalities
* top-down is usually irreversible, so mistakes tend to stick, whereas bottom-up is gradual and incremental, with creation and destruction along the way, though presumably with a positive slope.
* Almost everything built since World War II has an unnatural smoothness to it.
* So time can act as a cleanser of noise by confining to its dustbins all these overhyped works
* So time can act as a cleanser of noise by confining to its dustbins all these overhyped works. Some organizations even turn such scientific production into a cheap spectator sport, with ranking of the “ten hottest papers” in, say, rectal oncology or some such sub-sub-specialty.
* Unlike dilettantes, career professionals are to knowledge what prostitutes are to love.
* trying to be new in a standard way.
* I also extend the problem to epistemological grounds and make rules for what should be considered evidence: as with whether a cup should be considered half-empty or half-full, there are situations in which we focus on absence of evidence, others in which we focus on evidence. In some cases one can be confirmatory, not others—it depends on the risks. Take smoking, which was, at some stage, viewed as bringing small gains in pleasure and even health (truly, people thought it was a good thing). It took decades for its harm to become visible. Yet had someone questioned it, he would have faced the canned-naive-academized and faux-expert response “do you have evidence that this is harmful?” (the same type of response as “is there evidence that polluting is harmful?”). As usual, the solution is simple, an extension of via negativa and Fat Tony’s don’t-be-a-sucker rule: the non-natural needs to prove its benefits, not the natural—according to the statistical principle outlined earlier that nature is to be considered much less of a sucker than humans. In a complex domain, only time—a long time—is evidence.
* In a complex domain, only time—a long time—is evidence.
* The “do you have evidence” fallacy, mistaking evidence of no harm for no evidence of harm, is similar to the one of misinterpreting NED (no evidence of disease) for evidence of no disease. This is the same error as mistaking absence of evidence for evidence of absence, the one that tends to affect smart and educated people, as if education made people more confirmatory in their responses and more liable to fall into simple logical errors
* And recall that under nonlinearities, the simple statements “harmful” or “beneficial” break down: it is all in the dosage.
* The first principle of iatrogenics is as follows: we do not need evidence of harm to claim that a drug or an unnatural via positiva procedure is dangerous. Recall my comment earlier with the turkey problem that harm is in the future, not in the narrowly defined past. In other words, empiricism is not naive empiricism.
* Second principle of iatrogenics: it is not linear. We should not take risks with near-healthy people; but we should take a lot, a lot more risks with those deemed in danger.1
* Every time you take an antibiotic, you help, to some degree, the mutation of germs into antibiotic-resistant strains. Add to that the toying with your immune system. You transfer the antifragility from your body to the germ
* humans should not be given explosive toys (like atomic bombs, financial derivatives, or tools to create life).
* Let me phrase the last point a bit differently. If there is something in nature you don’t understand, odds are it makes sense in a deeper way that is beyond your understanding. So there is a logic to natural things that is much superior to our own. Just as there is a dichotomy in law: innocent until proven guilty as opposed to guilty until proven innocent, let me express my rule as follows: what Mother Nature does is rigorous until proven otherwise; what humans and science do is flawed until proven otherwise.
* theories come and go; experience stays. Explanations change all the time, and have changed all the time in history (because of causal opacity, the invisibility of causes) with people involved in the incremental development of ideas thinking they always had a definitive theory; experience remains constant.
* This random variability is often mistaken for information, hence leading to intervention
* If all of those dying prematurely from cancer had a malignant tumor, that does not mean that all malignant tumors lead to death from cancer.
* As usual, the ancients. As Ennius wrote, “The good is mostly in the absence of bad”; Nimium boni est, cui nihil est mali.
* the “pursuit of happiness” is not equivalent to the “avoidance of unhappiness.”
* From such examples, I derived the rule that what is called “healthy” is generally unhealthy, just as “social” networks are antisocial, and the “knowledge”-based economy is typically ignorant.
* The best test of empirical wisdom in someone is in where he puts the burden of evidence.
* If true wealth consists in worriless sleeping, clear conscience, reciprocal gratitude, absence of envy, good appetite, muscle strength, physical energy, frequent laughs, no meals alone, no gym class, some physical labor (or hobby), good bowel movements, no meeting rooms, and periodic surprises, then it is largely subtractive (elimination of iatrogenics).
* deprivation is a stressor—and we know what stressors do when allowed adequate recovery
* Breaking a fast feels like the exact opposite of a hangover.
* We are not the first generation to believe that the worst possible thing to befall us is death. But for the ancients, the worst possible outcome was not death, but a dishonorable death, or even just a regular one.

* Heroism has evolved through civilization from the martial arena to that of ideas
* Cowardice enhanced by technology is all connected
* dignity is worth nothing unless you earn it, unless you are willing to pay a price for it.
* If you take risks and face your fate with dignity, there is nothing you can do that makes you small; if you don’t take risks, there is nothing you can do that makes you grand, nothing.
* The “knowledge world” causes separation of knowing and doing (within the same person) and leads to the fragility of society
* if you see fraud and don’t say fraud, you are a fraud
* postdictors, who explain things after the fact—because they are in the business of talking—always look smarter than predictors.
* Never ask anyone for their opinion, forecast, or recommendation. Just ask them what they have—or don’t have—in their portfolio
* The psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer has a simple heuristic. Never ask the doctor what you should do. Ask him what he would do if he were in your place. You would be surprised at the difference.
* Suckers try to win arguments, nonsuckers try to win.

* If you don’t see this transfer of antifragility as theft, you certainly have a problem
* I fail to see why the arguments we’ve used against tobacco firms don’t apply—to some extent—to all other large companies that try to sell us things that may make us ill.
* business schools are more like acting schools
* A rule then hit me: with the exception of, say, drug dealers, small companies and artisans tend to sell us healthy products, ones that seem naturally and spontaneously needed; larger ones—including pharmaceutical giants—are likely to be in the business of producing wholesale iatrogenics, taking our money, and then, to add insult to injury, hijacking the state thanks to their army of lobbyists. Further, anything that requires marketing appears to carry such side effects. You certainly need an advertising apparatus to convince people that Coke brings them “happiness”—and it works
* There is no product that I particularly like that I have discovered through advertising and marketing:
* Anything one needs to market heavily is necessarily either an inferior product or an evil one. And it is highly unethical to portray something in a more favorable light than it actually is. One may make others aware of the existence of a product, say a new belly dancing belt, but I wonder why people don’t realize that, by definition, what is being marketed is necessarily inferior, otherwise it would not be advertised.
* We accept that people who boast are boastful and turn people off. How about companies? Why aren’t we turned off by companies that advertise how great they are
* There is a phenomenon called the treadmill effect, similar to what we saw with neomania: you need to make more and more to stay in the same place. Greed is antifragile—though not its victims.
* The point isn’t that making a living in a profession is inherently bad; rather, it’s that such a person becomes automatically suspect when dealing with public affairs, matters that involve others. The definition of the free man, according to Aristotle, is one who is free with his opinions—as a side effect of being free with his time.
* For Metternich, humanity started at the rank of baron; for Aristotle, as well as, though in a separate form, the English up until the twentieth century, it started at the rank of idle freeman, unpreoccupied with work. It never meant not working; it just meant not deriving your personal and emotional identity from your work, and viewing work as something optional, more like a hobby. In a way your profession does not identify you so much as other attributes, here your birth (but it could be something else). This is the f\*\*\* you money that allowed Thales of Miletus to gauge his own sincerity. For the Spartans, it was all about courage. For Fat Tony, humanity started at the level of “self-ownership.”
* In other words, for Fat Tony, it was a very, very specific definition of a free person: someone who cannot be squeezed into doing something he would otherwise never do
* Alan Blinder problem.
* This is the tragedy of modernity: as with neurotically overprotective parents, those trying to help are often hurting us the mos

The Logic Of Failure: Recognizing And Avoiding Error In Complex Situations
**************************************************************************

*Dietrich Dorner*  (4294969330)

* The unspoken assumption in conversations like these is always that we could do much better given the opportunity.
* The modern world is made up of innumerable interrelated subsystems, and we need to think in terms of these interrelations.
* It appears that, very early on, human beings developed a tendency to deal with problems on an ad hoc basis
* People with good intentions usually have few qualms about pursuing their goals
* As a result, incompetence that would otherwise have remained harmless often becomes dangerous,
* incompetent people with good intentions rarely suffer the qualms of conscience that sometimes inhibit the doings of competent people with bad intentions.
* The conviction that our intentions are unquestionably good may sanctify the most questionable means.
* No one is distressed by failing to see very subtle points that require specialized knowledge. We are distressed, however, if we overlook the obvious.
* There is no thinking without emotion
* Thought is embedded in a context of feeling and affect; thought influences, and is in turn influenced by, that context.
* Failure does not strike like a bolt from the blue; it develops gradually according to its own logic
* helplessness generates cynicism.
* The good participants differed from the had ones, however, in how often they tested their hypotheses
* The had participants failed to do this. For them, to propose a hypothesis was to understand reality; testing that hypothesis was unnecessary.
* Instead of generating hypotheses, they generated "truths."
* While the good participants often reflected on their own behavior, commented critically on it, and made efforts to modify it,
* the bad participants merely recapitulated their behavior.
* we guarantee that we remain ignorant of the real reasons for poor decisions, namely, inadequate plans and failure to anticipate the consequences.
* We regulate the situation and not the process,
* with the result that the inherent behavior of the system and our attempts at steering it combine to carry it beyond the desired mark.
* Safety rules are usually devised in such a way that a violator will not be instantly blown sky high, injured, or harmed in any other way but will instead find that his life is made easier
* And this is precisely what leads people down the primrose path
* The positive consequences of violating safety rules reinforce our tendency to violate them, so the likelihood of a disaster increases
* We find a tendency, under time pressure, to apply overdoses of established measures.
* We find an inability to think in terms of nonlinear networks of causation rather than of chains of causation-an inability,
* that is, to properly assess the side effects and repercussions of one's behavior.
* We find an inadequate understanding of exponential development
* difficulty in managing time, difficulty in evaluating exponentially developing processes, and difficulty in assessing side effects and long-term repercussions,
* that is, a tendency to think in terms of isolated cause-and-effect relationships.
* All are complicated systems that derive their complexity from the presence of many interrelated variables.
* All are, at least in part, "intransparent": one cannot see everything one would like to see.
* And all develop independent of external control, according to their own internal dynamic.
* characteristics we find here-complexity, intransparence, internal dynamics, and incomplete or incorrect understanding of the system-are basic to all intricate situations
* Complexity is the label we will give to the existence of many interdependent variables in a given system.
* We alight think that complexity could be regarded as an objective attribute of a system
* We might even think we could assign a numerical value to it, making it, for instance, the product of the number of features times the number of interrelationships
* If a system had ten variables and five links between them, then its "complexity quotient," measured in this way, would be fifty
* Supersignals reduce complexity, collapsing a number of features into one
* We cannot content ourselves with observing and analyzing situations at any single moment
* instead try to determine where the whole system is heading over time.
* The totality of such assumptions in an individual's mind-assumptions about the simple or complex links and the one-way or reciprocal influences between variables-constitute what we call that individual's "reality model."
* Implicit knowledge, therefore, can be very useful. Conversely, explicit knowledge, though it can be verbalized, cannot always be made useful
* An individual's reality model can be right or wrong, complete or incomplete
* As a rule it will be both incomplete and wrong, and one would do well to keep that probability in mind.
* The ability to admit ignorance or mistaken assumptions is indeed a sign of wisdom,
* Stating a goal comparatively ("better transportation network" or "more user-friendly") often indicates that we don't know precisely what we want
* Formless collections of data about random aspects of a situation merely add to the situation's impenetrability and are no aid to decision making.
* people's range of action is limited by their tendency to act in accordance with preestablished patterns.
* This distinction between positive and negative goals may sound academic, but it is important
* Negative goals (intentions to avoid something) are therefore often defined in quite vague, general terms
* it is inherent in the logic of "not" that negative goals are more likely to be vaguely defined
* A "nonstove" or "nonchair" is more difficult to define than a "stove" or "chair"
* A general goal is one that is defined by a single criterion or by a few.
* A specific goal is defined by many criteria; it can be described and conceptualized very precisely.
* We should distinguish between a general goal and an unclear one
* Unclear goals are ones that lack a criterion by which we can decide with certainty whether the goal has been achieved.
* people's actions are driven by an excessive (or exclusive) preoccupation with explicit goals accounts for a great deal of bad planning and counterproductive behavior.
* People concern themselves with the problems they have, not the ones they don't have (yet).
* When possible, we should try to convert negative goals into positive goals
* One way out of this dilemma is to set intermediate goals according to the criterion of maximum "efficiency diversity."'
* A situation is characterized by high efficiency diversity if it offers many different possibili ties ("diversity") for actions that have a high probability of success ("efficiency")
* By labeling a bundle of problems with a single conceptual label, we make dealing with that problem easier-provided we're not interested in solving it
* A simple label can't make the complex nature of a problem go away, but it can so obscure complexity that we lose sight of it.
* And that, of course, we find a great relief.
* study the list to determine interdependencies.
* rank problems in terms of importance and urgency.
* Delegation means that we commission other institutions and persons to do detail work for us but that we remain conscious of the role the delegated problem has in the overall problem.
* when we dump a problem on someone else, we instantly dismiss that problem from our mind; when it reappears in our consciousness, we respond with irritation over this new imposition
* When we are working on a given problem, we focus on that problem alone and not on problems that don't exist yet.
* So the mistake is less not knowing than not wanting to know.
* not wanting to know is a result not of ill will or egoism but of thinking that focuses on an immediately acute problem.
* advocates of progress often have too low an opinion of what already exists.
* in other words, we don't pay enough attention to what we want to leave unchanged.
* repair-service behavior: the mayor solves the problems that people bring to him
* It may happen that those who need little help get it all and those who need it most get none
* we don't understand the connections between problems (and don't even know that we don't understand them)
* we select the problems we will solve on the basis of irrelevant criteria, such as the obviousness of a problem or our competence to solve it.
* A flow situation is one in which tension is built up, then released, a sequence in which the individual experiences fear of failure, triumph over obstacles, renewed fear of failure, another triumph, and so on.
* hypotheses on why goals degenerate: the desire for safety and a lack of confidence in one's own capabilities.
* Unrecognized contradictory relations between partial goals lead to actions that inevitably replace one problem with another
* the physicist did not accuse the economist of deliberate malice, but he clearly did blame him for a lack of insight.
* What precisely is a system? A system is a network of many variables in causal relationships to one another.
* Positive feedback tends to undermine the stability of a system
* a system in which many variables are regulated by positive feedback can easily go haywire.
* The critical variables in a system are those that interact mutually with a large number of other variables in the system
* When we understand the links within a system, we can judge where the roots of certain deficiencies lie
* and can begin to define our goals more adequately.
* We need to know more than just the causal relationships between individual variables in a system, however
* There is no a priori appropriate level of detail
* It may happen that in working with a system we will have to move from one level of detail to another.
* As a rule, however, we should select the level of detail needed to let us understand the interrelationships among our "goal variables,"
* that is, among the variables that we want to influence.
* We need to know about the system's present status so as to predict future developments and assess the effects of past actions.
* To deal with a system as if it were a bundle of unrelated individual systems is, on the one hand, the method that saves the most cognitive energy
* On the other hand, it is the method that guarantees neglect of side effects and repercussions and therefore guarantees failure
* A reductive hypothesis of this kind, tying everything to one variable, has, of course, the positive virtue of being a holistic hypothesis
* which is desirable because it encompasses the entire system
* But it does so in a certain way, namely, by reducing the investment of cognitive energy.
* In addition to encompassing the entire system, a reductive hypothesis has the virtue of making it easy to deal with the system
* n its individual assessments this hypothesis is not wrong
* But in its overall assessment it is wrong because it is incomplete.
* The fact that reductive hypotheses provide simplistic explanations for what goes on in the world accounts not only for their popularity but also for their persistence
* We are infatuated with the hypotheses we propose because we assume they give us power over things
* We therefore avoid exposing them to the harsh light of real experience
* we prefer to gather only information that supports our hypotheses.'
* Our ideas are pale outlines,
* even the mental image of something as vivid as a rose cannot compare in intensity with the perception of a real rose's color and contours.
* Strategy is a system of makeshifts. It is more than a science. It is bringing knowledge to bear on practical life, the further elaboration of an original guiding idea under constantly changing circumstances. It is the art of acting under the pressure of the most demanding conditions.... That is why general principles, rules derived from them, and systems based on these rules cannot possibly have any value for strategy.
* A sensible and effective measure in one set of circumstances can become a dangerous course of action when conditions change.
* The need to adapt to particular circumstances, however, runs counter to our tendency to generalize and form abstract plans of action
* Anyone who has a lot of information, thinks a lot, and by thinking increases his understanding of a situation will have not less but more trouble coming to a clear decision.
* If we pretty much dispense with gathering information, it is easy for us to form a clear picture of reality and come to clear decisions
* Positive feedback between uncertainty and information gathering may explain why people sometimes deliberately refuse to take in information
* What we plainly see here, then, is an inverse relationship between information gathering and readiness to act.
* The less information gathered, the greater the readiness to act. And vice versa.
* We combat our uncertainty either by acting hastily on the basis of minimal information or by gathering excessive information
* Which of these patterns we follow depends on time pressure or the lack of it.
* In contrast to the rich set of spatial concepts we can use to understand patterns in space, we seem to rely on only a few mechanisms of prognostication to gain insight into the future.
* The primary such mechanism is extrapolation from the moment
* In other words, those aspects of the present that anger, worry, or delight us the most will play a key role in our predictions of the future
* Two factors come together in extrapolations from the moment: first, limited focus on a notable feature of the present
* second, extension of the perceived trend in a more or less linear and "monotone" fashion
* we cannot interpret numbers solely on the basis of their size
* To understand what they mean, we have to take into account the process that produced them, and that is not always easy.
* "Catastrophes" seem to hit suddenly, but in reality the way has been prepared for them
* Biological systems in which a predator (a lynx population, for example) lives on a prey population (say, caribou) often show cyclical development
* Never during the entire course of the experiment does he understand that he is dealing with a process in time
* He remains a captive of the moment.
* But even if we can't act in reverse, we can plan in reverse
* The fact that goals are often unclear may well explain why people show little spontaneous enthusiasm for reverse planning.
* problem is that only rarely and in relatively uninteresting areas can we plan completely
* Reverse planning works poorly or not at all if our goals are not clear;
* Perhaps the most important method for expanding a problem sector is thinking by analogy
* We can think of planning as a process of narrowing our problem sector
* researchers found that problem solvers working under stress used the personal pronoun I more often than those working in relaxed circumstances."'
* The trick is to plan with an appropriate degree of detail.
* Grote summed up: "Complete planning should be tempered by the concept of `nonplanning.' ""
* The more uncertain we are, the greater our tendency to overplan,
* The more extensive our understanding becomes, the more the planning process will impress on us the myriad possible results.
* Looking closely at a problem often increases our insecurity,
* a retreat into a minuscule but detailed planning process can help us feel we are applying the full force of our rational powers to the uncertainty of the situation
* Napoleon's motto in mind, expecting that something would surely go wrong but that we would find a way to deal with problems as they emerged
* If we expect the unexpected, we are better equipped to cope with it than if we lay extensive plans and believe that we have eliminated the unexpected.
* mathematics is not responsible for its misuses, and an idea expressed clearly in mathematical terms is preferable to one expressed uncleanly in lay terms.
* good problem solvers favored expressions that take circumstances and exceptions into account,
* that stress main points but don't ignore subordinate ones, and that suggest possibilities
* By contrast, the bad problem solvers used "absolute" concepts that do not admit of other possibilities or circumstances
* If we never look at the consequences of our behavior, we can always maintain the illusion of our competence.
* Ballistic behavior has the great advantage of relieving us of all accountability.
* "Methodism" may also arise from self-protective tendencies
* we prefer to assume that the new problem is of an old, familiar type that we have solved frequently in the past
* This assumption makes us feel secure-we see that we can cope with the situation
* Another proven means of protecting our sense of competence is to solve only those problems we know we can solve.
* If we solve the problems we can and avoid the ones we cannot, we reinforce our sense of competence.
* Human memory may have a very large capacity, but its "inflow capacity" is rather small.
* fading of received information may have its function.
* It may serve to provide us with those abstract schemes we need for forming "classes of equivalence" by shielding us from a superfluity of information.
* We don't neglect the "Implicit" problems of a situation because thinking about the possible side effects of the measures we are planning would overburden us terribly.
* Rather, we neglect them because we don't have those problems at the moment and therefore are not suffering from their ill effects.
* In short, we are captives of the moment.
* the ability to deal with problems in the most appropriate way is the hallmark of wisdom rather than of genius.
* There is probably no cut-and-dried method for teaching people how to manage complex, uncertain, and dynamic realities,
* because such realities, by their nature, do not present themselves in cut-and-dried form.
* training gave them what I would call "verbal intelligence" in the field of solving complex problems.
* Equipped with lots of shiny new concepts, they were able to talk about their thinking
* their actions, and the problems they were facing
* gain in eloquence left no mark at all on their performance
* Anyone who thinks play is nothing but play and dead earnest nothing but dead earnest hasn't understood either one.

The Marshmallow Test: Mastering Self-Control
********************************************

*Walter Mischel*  (4294968799)

* First, a tempting, appetitive stimulus has a consuming, arousing, motivating quality: it makes you want to eat the marshmallow,
* Second, it also provides descriptive cues that give information about its nonemotional, cognitive features: it’s round, white, thick, soft, edible.
* hot focus automatically triggers the impulsive reaction: to eat it or smoke it.
* A cool representation, in contrast, focuses on the more abstract, cognitive, informational aspects of the stimulus (it’s round, white, soft, small) and tells you what it is like, without making it mo
* When cued to focus on the cool features of their rewards, children waited twice as long as when prompted to focus on the hot features
* when the child thought hot about the specific rewards for which he was waiting, it soon became impossible for him to continue to delay.
* In short, we are less likely to delay gratification when we feel sad or bad
* The power is not in the stimulus, however, but in how it is mentally appraised
* if you change how you think about it, its impact on what you feel and do changes.
* trying to change how we think about or “mentally represent” stimuli and experiences that have become deeply ingrained can be as futile as trying to be your own brain surgeon.
* The limbic system consists of primitive brain structures located under the cortex on top of the brain stem, which developed early in our evolution
* The amygdala rapidly mobilizes the body for action.
* It does not pause to think and reflect or worry about long-term consequences.
* Activation of the hot system triggers instantaneous action
* A focus on the hot features of a temptation easily triggers the Go! response
* High stress activates the hot system
* And the hot system is predominant in the first few years of life, which makes it especially difficult for the young preschooler to exert self-control.
* The hot and cool systems continuously and seamlessly interact in a reciprocal relationship:
* as one becomes more active the other becomes less active
* Self-control ability is rooted in the PFC.
* e way to momentarily escape the hot system is to imagine how someone else would behave
* It’s easier to use the cool system when making hot choices for others rather than for oneself
* Prolonged stress impairs the PFC,
* The longer stress persists, the more those cognitive abilities are hurt and the more permanent the damage, ultimately leading to mental as well as physical illness.
* Toddlers who distanced themselves from their controlling mothers, who literally moved away when she made approach overtures, were able to delay longer on the Marshmallow Test at age five.
* the toddlers who had equally controlling mothers but who hung close when Mom made her bids for attention focused on the temptations when they took the Marshmallow Test and quickly rang the bell.
* The message here is that parents who overcontrol their toddlers risk undermining the development of their children’s self-control skills,
* those who support and encourage autonomy in problem-solving efforts are likely to maximize their children’s chances of coming home from preschool eager to tell them how they got their two marshmallows
* to effectively resist a hot temptation (whether to eat the marshmallow now or cave in to any other temptation), the inhibitory No! response had to replace the hot Go! response
* and it had to do this quickly and automatically, like a reflex.
* you can trick the hot system into reflexively and unconsciously doing the work for you
* But unless you incorporate the resistance plan into the hot system, it is unlikely to be activated when you need it most.
* The grasshopper is indulging in hot-system pleasures, while the ant is delaying gratification for the sake of later survival.
* Immediate rewards activate the hot, automatic, reflexive, unconscious limbic system, which pays little attention to delayed consequences
* It is driven by the sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch of the object of desire
* I can resist everything except temptation
* If the differences are due to nature, society may decide to take pity on the unfortunates who lost out in the genetic roulette
* The newborn’s slate, far from being blank is deeply encrypted.
* In that theory, when blood was predominant, the person was sanguine, characterized as good-natured and cheerful;
* black bile underlay the melancholic individual who tended to be anxious and moody;
* readiness to be angry and irritable, due to too much yellow bile, marked the choleric
* when phlegm predominated, the person was phlegmatic, or easygoing and slow to become aroused.
* even with identical twins reared together, it is entirely possible for one to develop schizophrenia, severe depression, or other mental or physical illnesses, while the other lives out a healthy life.
* In the human body, each of approximately a trillion cells holds within its nucleus a complete and identical sequence of DNA.
* all biological processes are influenced by context, including the social-psychological environment.
* the environment is most influential early in life
* the stress experienced by mothers exposed to violence by their intimate partners may be transmitted to their offspring, making the babies more vulnerable to serious behavioral problems even much later
* the sobering message is that the inheritance of both risk and resilience in dealing with social interactions may be passed on across generations.
* First, genetic endowment is an important determinant of behavior.
* Just as important, however, is the maternal environment early in life.
* The dull rats put into the enriched environments became significantly brighter,
* the bright ones stuck in the impoverished life space got duller, showing a significant decline in their performance
* what genes do depends on the environments in which they are functioning.
* Our genes influence how we deal with the environment
* The environment affects which parts of our DNA are expressed and which are ignored.
* most predispositions are prewired to some degree, but they are also flexible, with plasticity and potential for change.
* Removing those glasses increases the risk for depression.
* Wearing them all the time leads to illusory optimism and excessive risk taking.
* Each child who waited successfully had a distinctive methodology for self-control, but they all shared three features of EF
* First, they had to remember and actively keep in mind their chosen goal and the contingency (“If I eat the one now, I don’t get the two later”).
* Second, they had to monitor their progress toward their goal and make the necessary corrections by shifting their attention and cognitions flexibly between goal-oriented thoughts and temptation-reduci
* Third, they had to inhibit impulsive responses
* But outwardly cool tasks may require EF as well.
* an ostensibly cool task like learning arithmetic in school can easily become hot when fear of failure and performance anxiety activate the hot system and attenuate the cool system, escalating stress a
* Just as the negative effects of stress depend on the individual’s perceived stress,
* the impact of temptations depends on how they are appraised and mentally represented,
* potential health benefits of our abilities, achievements, and prospects depend on how we interpret and evaluate them
* the “entity theorists,” see their abilities as frozen from birth at some fixed level that they cannot change
* children stuck with an entity theory about their own abilities tend to have a particularly difficult time when schoolwork becomes increasingly challenging.
* even preschool children’s belief that they could control outcomes by their own behavior was significantly linked to how hard they tried, how long they persisted, and how successful they were at self-c
* The positive consequences of optimism are dazzling, and would be hard to believe if they were not so well supported by research
* Shelley Taylor and her colleagues showed that optimists cope more effectively with stress and are better protected against its adverse effects.
* Psychologist Charles Carver and his colleagues showed that when optimists have coronary bypass surgery, they recover more quickly than pessimists do.
* In short, optimism is a blessing to be wished for, as long as it reasonably connects to reality.
* Because optimists have higher overall expectations of success, they are more willing to delay gratification, even when it is difficult to do so.
* The findings also showed that those who started with low generalized expectations began as if they had already failed at the task
* the more emotionally connected you become to your future self, the more you will incorporate it into your present self-conception and budget,
* If you feel closely connected to your future self, will you be more likely to take into account how your present actions will impact how you feel later
* Those who felt closely connected to the future self thought more about the delayed long-term consequences of their action
* it was this attention to future consequences that accounted for their unwillingness to make greedy, selfish decisions.
* when we imagine the future or think about the past we are traversing a single dimension: psychological distance
* e greater the psychological distance, the more abstract and high-level information processing becomes, increasingly governed by the cool cognitive system.
* If you want to decide how something (a new job, an exotic trip) will feel in the future, you might try to imagine yourself doing it in the present.
* Simulate the events as vividly as possible, in great detail, by essentially pre-living them.
* it is much easier to resist immediate temptations if we think about them in abstract, cool ways or as being far away in space and time.
* Such high-level, abstract thinking activates the cool system and attenuates the hot system

* We do not spontaneously learn that we don’t learn that we don’t learn. The problem lies in the structure of our minds: we don’t learn rules, just facts, and only facts. Metarules (such as the rule that we have a tendency to not learn rules) we don’t seem to be good at getting. We scorn the abstract; we scorn it with passion.
* everybody knows that you need more prevention than treatment, but few reward acts of prevention. We glorify those who left their names in history books at the expense of those contributors about whom our books are silent. We humans are not just a superficial race (this may be curable to some extent); we are a very unfair one.

* Any reduction of the world around us can have explosive consequences since it rules out some sources of uncertainty; it drives us to a misunderstanding of the fabric of the world. For instance, you may think that radical Islam (and its values) are your allies against the threat of Communism, and so you may help them develop, until they send two planes into downtown Manhattan.

* I ran into a colleague of mine, Demetrius, on Park Avenue, and, as I started talking to him, an anxiety-ridden woman, losing all inhibitions, jumped into the conversation: “Hey, do the two of you know what’s going on?” People on the sidewalk looked dazed. Earlier I had seen a few adults silently sobbing in the trading room of First Boston. I had spent the day at the epicenter of the events, with shell-shocked people running around like rabbits in front of headlights. When I got home, my cousin Alexis called to tell me that his neighbor committed suicide, jumping from his upper-floor apartment. It did not even feel eerie. It felt like Lebanon, with a twist: having seen both, I was struck that financial distress could be more demoralizing than war (just consider that financial problems and the accompanying humiliations can lead to suicide, but war doesn’t appear to do so directly).

* While this distinction (between Mediocristan and Extremistan) has severe ramifications for both social fairness and the dynamics of events, let us see its application to knowledge, which is where most of its value lies. If a Martian came to earth and engaged in the business of measuring the heights of the denizens of this happy planet, he could safely stop at a hundred humans to get a good picture of the average height. If you live in Mediocristan, you can be comfortable with what you have measured—provided that you know for sure that it comes from Mediocristan. You can also be comfortable with what you have learned from the data. The epistemological consequence is that with Mediocristan-style randomness it is not possible\* to have a Black Swan surprise such that a single event can dominate a phenomenon. Primo, the first hundred days should reveal all you need to know about the data. Secondo, even if you do have a surprise, as we saw in the case of the heaviest human, it would not be consequential.

* Let us call it the domain specificity of our reactions. By domain-specific I mean that our reactions, our mode of thinking, our intuitions, depend on the context in which the matter is presented, what evolutionary psychologists call the “domain” of the object or the event. The classroom is a domain; real life is another. We react to a piece of information not on its logical merit, but on the basis of which framework surrounds it, and how it registers with our social-emotional system. Logical problems approached one way in the classroom might be treated differently in daily life. Indeed they are treated differently in daily life.

The more you summarize, the more order you put in, the less randomness. Hence the same condition that makes us simplify pushes us to think that the world is less random than it actually is.

* Conventional wisdom holds that memory is like a serial recording device like a computer diskette. In reality, memory is dynamic—not static—like a paper on which new texts (or new versions of the same text) will be continuously recorded, thanks to the power of posterior information. (In a remarkable insight, the nineteenth-century Parisian poet Charles Baudelaire compared our memory to a palimpsest, a type of parchment on which old texts can be erased and new ones written over them.) Memory is more of a self-serving dynamic revision machine: you remember the last time you remembered the event and, without realizing it, change the story at every subsequent remembrance.

* Note that neurobiologists make, roughly, a similar distinction to that between System 1 and System 2, except that they operate along anatomical lines. Their distinction differentiates between parts of the brain, the cortical part, which we are supposed to use for thinking, and which distinguishes us from other animals, and the fast-reacting limbic brain, which is the center of emotions, and which we share with other mammals.
* Many people labor in life under the impression that they are doing something right, yet they may not show solid results for a long time. They need a capacity for continuously adjourned gratification to survive a steady diet of peer cruelty without becoming demoralized. They look like idiots to their cousins, they look like idiots to their peers, they need courage to continue. No confirmation comes to them, no validation, no fawning students, no Nobel, no Shnobel. “How was your year?” brings them a small but containable spasm of pain deep inside, since almost all of their years will seem wasted to someone looking at their life from the outside. Then bang, the lumpy event comes that brings the grand vindication. Or it may never come.

* Of all the people he knew, Nero was the least genetically designed for such a strategy. His brain disagreed so heavily with his body that he found himself in a state of continuous warfare. It was his body that was his problem, which accumulated physical fatigue from the neurobiological effect of exposure to the small continuous losses, Chinese-water-torture-style, throughout the day. Nero discovered that the losses went to his emotional brain, bypassing his higher cortical structures and slowly affecting his hippocampus and weakening his memory. The hippocampus is the structure where memory is supposedly controlled. It is the most plastic part of the brain; it is also the part that is assumed to absorb all the damage from repeated insults like the chronic stress we experience daily from small doses of negative feelings—as opposed to the invigorating “good stress” of the tiger popping up occasionally in your living room. You can rationalize all you want; the hippocampus takes the insult of chronic stress seriously, incurring irreversible atrophy. Contrary to popular belief, these small, seemingly harmless stressors do not strengthen you; they can amputate part of your self.
* Humans will believe anything you say provided you do not exhibit the smallest shadow of diffidence; like animals, they can detect the smallest crack in your confidence before you express it. The trick is to be as smooth as possible in personal manners. It is much easier to signal self-confidence if you are exceedingly polite and friendly; you can control people without having to offend their sensitivity.

* Silent evidence pervades everything connected to the notion of history. By history, I don’t just mean those learned-but-dull books in the history section (with Renaissance paintings on their cover to attract buyers). History, I will repeat, is any succession of events seen with the effect of posteriority.
* It is so easy to avoid looking at the cemetery while concocting historical theories. But this is not just a problem with history. It is a problem with the way we construct samples and gather evidence in every domain. We shall call this distortion a bias, i.e., the difference between what you see and what is there. By bias I mean a systematic error consistently showing a more positive, or negative, effect from the phenomenon, like a scale that unfailingly shows you a few pounds heavier or lighter than your true weight, or a video camera that adds a few sizes to your waistline. This bias has been rediscovered here and there throughout the past century across disciplines, often to be rapidly forgotten (like Cicero’s insight). As drowned worshippers do not write histories of their experiences (it is better to be alive for that), so it is with the losers in history, whether people or ideas. Remarkably, historians and other scholars in the humanities who need to understand silent evidence the most do not seem to have a name for it (and I looked hard). As for journalists, fuhgedaboudit! They are industrial producers of the distortion.

* This in itself greatly weakens the notion of “because” that is often propounded by scientists, and almost always misused by historians. We have to accept the fuzziness of the familiar “because” no matter how queasy it makes us feel (and it does makes us queasy to remove the analgesic illusion of causality). I repeat that we are explanation-seeking animals who tend to think that everything has an identifiable cause and grab the most apparent one as the explanation. Yet there may not be a visible because; to the contrary, frequently there is nothing, not even a spectrum of possible explanations. But silent evidence masks this fact. Whenever our survival is in play, the very notion of because is severely weakened. The condition of survival drowns all possible explanations. The Aristotelian “because” is not there to account for a solid link between two items, but rather, as we saw in Chapter 6, to cater to our hidden weakness for imparting explanations.

* Now, go read any of the classical thinkers who had something practical to say about the subject of chance, such as Cicero, and you find something different: a notion of probability that remains fuzzy throughout, as it needs to be, since such fuzziness is the very nature of uncertainty. Probability is a liberal art; it is a child of skepticism, not a tool for people with calculators on their belts to satisfy their desire to produce fancy calculations and certainties. Before Western thinking drowned in its “scientific” mentality, what is arrogantly called the Enlightenment, people prompted their brain to think—not compute. In a beautiful treatise now vanished from our consciousness, Dissertation on the Search for Truth, published in 1673, the polemist Simon Foucher exposed our psychological predilection for certainties. He teaches us the art of doubting, how to position ourselves between doubting and believing. He writes: “One needs to exit doubt in order to produce science—but few people heed the importance of not exiting from it prematurely. … It is a fact that one usually exits doubt without realizing it.” He warns us further: “We are dogma-prone from our mother’s wombs.”

* The great baseball coach Yogi Berra has a saying, “It is tough to make predictions, especially about the future.”
* The future ain’t what it used to be,
* True, our knowledge does grow, but it is threatened by greater increases in confidence, which make our increase in knowledge at the same time an increase in confusion, ignorance, and conceit.
* Epistemic arrogance bears a double effect: we overestimate what we know, and underestimate uncertainty, by compressing the range of possible uncertain states (i.e., by reducing the space of the unknown).
* Our human race is affected by a chronic underestimation of the possibility of the future straying from the course initially envisioned (in addition to other biases that sometimes exert a compounding effect).
* The appearance of busyness reinforces the perception of causality, of the link between results and one’s role in them.
* When you are employed, hence dependent on other people’s judgment, looking busy can help you claim responsibility for the results in a random environment
* additional knowledge of the minutiae of daily business can be useless, even actually toxic
* The more information you give someone, the more hypotheses they will formulate along the way, and the worse off they will be.
* the more detailed knowledge one gets of empirical reality, the more one will see the noise (i.e., the anecdote) and mistake it for actual information.
* There must be some disciplines with true experts. Let us ask the following questions: Would you rather have your upcoming brain surgery performed by a newspaper’s science reporter or by a certified brain surgeon? On the other hand, would you prefer to listen to an economic forecast by someone with a PhD in finance from some “prominent” institution such as the Wharton School, or by a newspaper’s business writer? While the answer to the first question is empirically obvious, the answer to the second one isn’t at all. We can already see the difference between “know-how” and “know-what.” The Greeks made a distinction between technē and epistēmē. The empirical school of medicine of Menodotus of Nicomedia and Heraclites of Tarentum wanted its practitioners to stay closest to technē (i.e., “craft”), and away from epistēmē (i.e., “knowledge,” “science”).
* Simply, things that move, and therefore require knowledge, do not usually have experts, while things that don’t move seem to have some experts. In other words, professions that deal with the future and base their studies on the nonrepeatable past have an expert problem (with the exception of the weather and businesses involving short-term physical processes, not socioeconomic ones). I am not saying that no one who deals with the future provides any valuable information (as I pointed out earlier, newspapers can predict theater opening hours rather well), but rather that those who provide no tangible added value are generally dealing with the future.
* The problem with experts is that they do not know what they do not know.
* We humans are the victims of an asymmetry in the perception of random events. We attribute our successes to our skills, and our failures to external events outside our control, namely to randomness. We feel responsible for the good stuff, but not for the bad. This causes us to think that we are better than others at whatever we do for a living. Ninety-four percent of Swedes believe that their driving skills put them in the top 50 percent of Swedish drivers; 84 percent of Frenchmen feel that their lovemaking abilities put them in the top half of French lovers.
* The other effect of this asymmetry is that we feel a little unique, unlike others, for whom we do not perceive such an asymmetry

* With human projects and ventures we have another story. These are often scalable, as I said in Chapter 3. With scalable variables, the ones from Extremistan, you will witness the exact opposite effect. Let’s say a project is expected to terminate in 79 days, the same expectation in days as the newborn female has in years. On the 79th day, if the project is not finished, it will be expected to take another 25 days to complete. But on the 90th day, if the project is still not completed, it should have about 58 days to go. On the 100th, it should have 89 days to go. On the 119th, it should have an extra 149 days. On day 600, if the project is not done, you will be expected to need an extra 1,590 days. As you see, the longer you wait, the longer you will be expected to wait.
* The classical model of discovery is as follows: you search for what you know (say, a new way to reach India) and find something you didn’t know was there (America).
* We forget about unpredictability when it is our turn to predict. This is why people can read this chapter and similar accounts, agree entirely with them, yet fail to heed their arguments when thinking about the future
* “Fundamentally” unpredictable? I will explain what he means using a modern framework. Consider the following property of knowledge: If you expect that you will know tomorrow with certainty that your boyfriend has been cheating on you all this time, then you know today with certainty that your boyfriend is cheating on you and will take action today, say, by grabbing a pair of scissors and angrily cutting all his Ferragamo ties in half. You won’t tell yourself, This is what I will figure out tomorrow, but today is different so I will ignore the information and have a pleasant dinner. This point can be generalized to all forms of knowledge. There is actually a law in statistics called the law of iterated expectations, which I outline here in its strong form: if I expect to expect something at some date in the future, then I already expect that something at present.
* But there is a weaker form of this law of iterated knowledge. It can be phrased as follows: to understand the future to the point of being able to predict it, you need to incorporate elements from this future itself. If you know about the discovery you are about to make in the future, then you have almost made it. Assume that you are a special scholar in Medieval University’s Forecasting Department specializing in the projection of future history (for our purposes, the remote twentieth century). You would need to hit upon the inventions of the steam machine, electricity, the atomic bomb, and the Internet, as well as the institution of the airplane onboard massage and that strange activity called the business meeting, in which well-fed, but sedentary, men voluntarily restrict their blood circulation with an expensive device called a necktie.
* Prediction requires knowing about technologies that will be discovered in the future. But that very knowledge would almost automatically allow us to start developing those technologies right away. Ergo, we do not know what we will know.

* The postcrash years were entertaining for me, intellectually. I attended conferences in finance and mathematics of uncertainty; not once did I find a speaker, Nobel or no Nobel, who understood what he was talking about when it came to probability, so I could freak them out with my questions. They did “deep work in mathematics,” but when you asked them where they got their probabilities, their explanations made it clear that they had fallen for the ludic fallacy—there was a strange cohabitation of technical skills and absence of understanding that you find in idiot savants. Not once did I get an intelligent answer or one that was not ad hominem. Since I was questioning their entire business, it was understandable that I drew all manner of insults: “obsessive,” “commercial,” “philosophical,” “essayist,” “idle man of leisure,” “repetitive,” “practitioner” (this is an insult in academia), “academic” (this is an insult in business). Being on the receiving end of angry insults is not that bad; you can get quickly used to it and focus on what is not said. Pit traders are trained to handle angry rants. If you work in the chaotic pits, someone in a particularly bad mood from losing money might start cursing at you until he injures his vocal cords, then forget about it and, an hour later, invite you to his Christmas party. So you become numb to insults, particularly if you teach yourself to imagine that the person uttering them is a variant of a noisy ape with little personal control. Just keep your composure, smile, focus on analyzing the speaker not the message, and you’ll win the argument. An ad hominem attack against an intellectual, not against an idea, is highly flattering. It indicates that the person does not have anything intelligent to say about your message.

* The exact opposite of redundancy is naïve optimization. I tell everyone to avoid attending (orthodox) economics classes and say that economics will fail us and blow us up (and, as we will see, we have proofs that it failed us; but, as I kept saying in the original text, we did not need them; all we needed was to look at the lack of scientific rigor—and of ethics). The reason is the following: It is largely based on notions of naïve optimization, mathematized (poorly) by Paul Samuelson—and this mathematics contributed massively to the construction of an error-prone society. An economist would find it inefficient to maintain two lungs and two kidneys: consider the costs involved in transporting these heavy items across the savannah. Such optimization would, eventually, kill you, after the first accident, the first “outlier.” Also, consider that if we gave Mother Nature to economists, it would dispense with individual kidneys: since we do not need them all the time, it would be more “efficient” if we sold ours and used a central kidney on a time-share basis. You could also lend your eyes at night since you do not need them to dream.

The Optimism Bias
*****************

*Tali Sharot*  (4294968111)

* Because we use the same neural system to recall the past as we do to imagine the future
* recollection also ends up being a reconstructive process rather than a videolike replay of past events, and thus is susceptible to inaccuracies.
* the optimism bias is so powerful precisely because, like many other illusions, it is not fully accessible to conscious deliberation.
* optimism bias—the inclination to overestimate the likelihood of encountering positive events in the future and to underestimate the likelihood of experiencing negative events.
* the optimism illusion had developed for a reason: It has a function.
* The brain is organized in a way that enables optimistic beliefs to change the way we view and interact with the world around us, making optimism a self-fulfilling prophecy
* An illusion is an illusion because we perceive it at face value—as reality.
* spatial disorientation, also known as vertigo,
* Thatcherized” (this is the term for inverting the face without rotating the mouth and eyes).
* The brain is used to detect upright faces and expressions
* As in most illusions, learning of the illusion and its roots does not erase the illusion
* The illusion, which feels very real, is dissociated from the knowledge (when available) that the perception is false.
* cognitive illusions, rather than sensory ones, are much harder to accept.
* Contrary to visual illusions, in which we often share the same false perception as those around us, other types of illusions differ slightly according to where we stand
* Because we can identify these illusions and biases in others but not in ourselves, we conclude that we are less susceptible to bias than most other people
* An introspection illusion is the strong sense people have that they can directly access the processes underlying their mental states.
* Scalia seems to have experienced an introspection illusion. An introspection illusion is the strong sense people have that they can directly access the processes underlying their mental states. Most mental processes, however, are largely unavailable for conscious interpretation. The catch is that people are unaware of their unawareness. Thus, although introspection feels as if we are simply observing our inner intentions, it is largely an inference about our inner intentions, rather than a true reflection of them.33
* Instead of truthfully reflecting his inner mental processes, he was inaccurately inferring and constructing his intentions and past mental state.
* we can unknowingly create verbal rationalizations for preferences and intentions that we do not actually possess
* thinking too much can lead to suboptimal judgments.
* Whether you are selecting apartments or jelly beans, deliberation has been shown to hinder satisfaction
* This knowledge—that old age, sickness, decline of mental power, and oblivion are around the corner—is less than optimistic
* While the capacity for both awareness and prospection has clear survival advantages, conscious foresight also came at an enormous price—an understanding that somewhere in the future, death awaits us. This knowledge—that old age, sickness, decline of mental power, and oblivion are around the corner—is less than optimistic. It causes a great amount of anguish and fear. Ajit Varkil, a biologist at the University of California at San Diego, argues that the awareness of mortality on its own would have led evolution to a dead end.31 The despair would have interfered with daily function, bringing the activities and cognitive functions needed for survival to a stop. Humans possess this awareness, and yet we survive. How?
* The knowledge of death had to emerge at the same time as its irrational denial.
* A brain that could consciously voyage through time would be an evolutionary barrier unless it had an optimism bias
* The idea behind the self-fulfilling prophecy is that it is not a forecast of a future event, but a cause of the event. Don’t get me wrong: Predicting your team will win the championship does not necessarily make it so. It is not magic. Not all athletes who envision their success will actually go home with a championship cup or a gold medal. Many factors will determine the outcome, and the opposing team may be just as confident. However, a prediction has an influence on the event it predicts because people’s behavior is determined by their subjective perception of reality, rather than by objective reality. Therefore, believing in a positive outcome will enhance the probability that the desired outcome will be realized.
* people’s behavior is determined by their subjective perception of reality, rather than by objective reality.
* The term self-fulfilling prophecy was coined by the sociologist Robert Merton in 1948. According to Merton, “The self-fulfilling prophecy is, in the beginning, a false definition of the situation evoking a new behavior which makes the originally false conception come true. The specious validity of the self-fulfilling prophecy perpetuates a reign of error. For the prophet will cite the actual course of events as proof that he was right from the very beginning.”4
* The specious validity of the self-fulfilling prophecy perpetuates a reign of error.
* For the prophet will cite the actual course of events as proof that he was right from the very beginning.
* Humans are hugely affected by the expectations placed upon them
* Theory of mind is our ability to think about what other people are thinking
* A well-functioning frontal lobe will inhibit the action that is associated with the less desirable goal and promote the action that is associated with the more desirable one.
* The notion that holding low expectations will protect us from disappointment is known as defensive pessimism. Low expectations, however, do not diminish the pain of failure. Not only do negative expectations lead to worse results; they also fail to protect us from negative emotions when unwanted outcomes occur. For instance, students who had low expectations of their performance on an undergraduate psychology exam felt just as bad when those expectations came true as students who expected to do well.21
* Low expectations, however, do not diminish the pain of failure.
* negative expectations lead to worse results; they also fail to protect us from negative emotions when unwanted outcomes occur
* In effect, people who react to illness with passive acceptance of their own impending death, such as James, die prematurely.22 Although James and Peter are the creations of my imagination, they could have easily been two participants in a study conducted in 1996. This study examined a group of patients who had experienced heart attacks and were following a rehabilitation program. The researchers found that, just like Peter, optimists exercised more and were more likely to reduce their body-fat levels, thereby reducing their overall coronary risk. They were also more likely to take vitamins and eat low-fat diets.23 The result: Optimists lived longer.24
* Pessimists, on the other hand, die younger. A study tracking one thousand healthy people over fifty years found that pessimists were more likely to encounter an early death than optimists. What killed these poor naysayers? Apparently, pessimists were more likely to perish prematurely as a result of accidental and violent events—car crashes, drowning, work accidents, and homicide were more often in their cards. Why would a bleak outlook result in such tragic deaths? It seems that a pessimistic outlook promoted risk-taking behavior because the pessimists believed they did not have much to lose.25
* The secret to the positive relationship between optimism and health is that optimists are selective risk takers
* all’s well that ends well; if it is not yet well, then it is not quite the end.
* High levels of oxytocin reduce our uncertainty about social stimuli
* More often than not, people expect to do better personally in the near future while anticipating that the rest of the country will go down the drain
* Not only do people hold an optimism bias about their personal future; in addition, they hold a pessimistic bias about everyone else’s.
* The significance of having more money, for example, steadily decreased as a person aged.
* If you want to be happy for a few hours, get drunk. If you want to be happy for a few years, get a wife. If you want to be happy forever, get a garden
* Studies consistently show that if there is any correlation between having offspring and happiness, it is a negative one.
* In fact, middle-aged people (thirty-five to fifty-four years old) are the least satisfied
* The participants were requested to pause throughout the day and state their present feelings as well as their activities.
* This technique produced what Kahneman calls “a measure of experienced happiness.”
* Our happiness is thus not affected to a large extent by reflecting on our lives, but by the flood of feelings that are constantly generated within us.
* Commuting to and from work contributed most negatively to satisfaction with life.
* happiness, whether experienced or reflected, is not necessarily the most significant factor for the continuation of humankind
* Studies in behavioral economics show that the value people assign to money is best described in a nonlinear fashion
* If the money earned for a job is doubled, people do not perceive the value of that job as double, but as a bit less than double
* People perceive money in a similar fashion. If you give someone ten thousand dollars to do a job and then add fifty dollars as a bonus, the person will not be that impressed. However, if you pay someone seventy dollars to do a job and then add another fifty dollars, the person will be extremely thankful. Studies in behavioral economics show that the value people assign to money is best described in a nonlinear fashion.15 If the money earned for a job is doubled, people do not perceive the value of that job as double, but as a bit less than double. Like the perception of loudness or light, the subjective value of a dollar depends on the starting point. A dollar is valued more if you start off with only one dollar than if you start off with one hundred dollars. Therefore, the more you have, the more you need to increase your wealth in order to even notice a difference that would affect your happiness.
* A dollar is valued more if you start off with only one dollar than if you start off with one hundred dollars.
* the more you have, the more you need to increase your wealth in order to even notice a difference that would affect your happiness.
* even winning millions in the lottery does not seem to make us feel better for more than a few months.
* According to dual-process theory, memory retrieval includes two distinct processes: familiarity and recollection.
* Having extremely vivid memories of past emotional experiences and only weak memories of past everyday events means we maintain a biased perception of the past. We tend to view the past as a concentrated time line of emotionally exciting events. We remember the arousing aspects of an episode and forget the boring bits. A summer vacation will be recalled for its highlights, and the less exciting parts will fade away with time, eventually to be forgotten forever. As a result, when we estimate how our next summer vacation will make us feel, we overestimate the positive. An imprecise picture of the past is one reason for our inaccurate forecasts of the future.
* Our belief that happiness is just around the corner is, ironically enough, what keeps our spirits high in the present.
* depression is the inability to construct a future.
* clinically depressed individuals find it difficult to create detailed images of future events, and when they do, they tend to be pessimistic about them
* While severely depressed patients are pessimistic, mildly depressed people are actually pretty good at predicting what may happen to them in the near future—
* We also find failure, rejection, abandonment, and change difficult to deal with.
* People with a propensity for depression tend to be biased toward negative stimuli.
* what her patients experienced was not a sensation of becoming happy. Rather, it was one of regaining control.
* depression is associated with impaired connectivity between the ACC and the amygdal
* optimism, on the other hand, is associated with enhanced connectivity between the ACC and the amygdala
* What the marketing people at Guinness tapped into was a central aspect of human nature we tend to overlook—the joy of savoring. Sometimes expecting a good thing is more pleasurable than actually experiencing it. Consider the hours blissfully spent daydreaming about an upcoming vacation—we get our money’s worth before we even board the plane. Or consider the excitement while getting ready for a keenly awaited date, all sorts of future scenarios running through our mind; the childhood enthusiasm weeks before Halloween or an upcoming birthday; the exhilaration before reuniting with a loved one. I could go on and on.
* Friday is ranked higher than Sunday, although Friday is a workday and Sunday is not
* Sunday, while a day of rest, does not bring with it the joy of anticipation.
* Whether good or bad, our emotional state is determined both by feelings that are triggered by the world at present and those generated by our expectations of the future.
* When it comes to adverse events, most of us choose to get it over with as soon as possible.
* We want to avoid the dread that comes with anticipating pain.
* Consider another scenario: You are at the dentist’s office for your annual checkup. While examining your teeth, your dentist concludes that, unfortunately, you need a root canal. There is no patient scheduled after you, so the dentist can conduct the procedure right away. Alternatively, you can be penciled in for later that afternoon or for next week. What do you do? When it comes to adverse events, most of us choose to get it over with as soon as possible. The reason is simple: We want to avoid the dread that comes with anticipating pain. Instead of spending our time worrying and fearing, we would rather face the pain immediately and be done with it.
* What classic decision-making theories fail to account for is the negative value of dread
* This decision may seem irrational. Traditional economic theorists would certainly claim so. According to these classic decision-making models, humans are rational agents who try to optimize expected utility.9 Utility is an economic term that refers to the relative desirability of an object, or to the satisfaction we can derive from it. Electric shocks are neither desirable nor satisfying. So if on a scale of 1 (not at all painful) to 100 (so painful, one would rather die) we expect a 120-volt shock to be about 40, and are willing to pay one hundred dollars to avoid it, then we should be willing to pay one hundred dollars to avoid it now and one hundred dollars to avoid it in ten years. This is because in both cases we expect the shock to be painful to the same degree. Now, let’s say you are willing to pay one hundred dollars to avoid the shock today and two hundred dollars to avoid it in a year (although in both cases the expected pain is 40 on the pain scale). This is a violation of rational behavior. Or is it?
* The negative influence of anticipating an unwanted event on our physical and mental health can sometimes be worse than the effect of experiencing the event.
* Second, the more vividly we are able to imagine an event, the greater the pleasure from anticipating it.
* If we are unable to construct a detailed image of the burger, one that includes the smell and texture of it, anticipating it will be less enjoyable.
* Third, how probable you think the event is influences how joyful anticipating it will be
* The optimism bias is, by definition, our tendency to overestimate the probability of positive events and underestimate the probability of negative ones. That’s not all. Optimistic people imagine positive future events with greater vividness and detail than negative events and imagine them occurring nearer in time. So the more optimistic you are, the more likely you are to imagine positive events as nearer in time, with greater detail, and with higher probability than negative events.14 Optimism thus modulates the same factors that influence the value of anticipation: predicted pleasure, vividness, the expected time of the event, and its probability.

* it seems that temporal discounting steers our decisions in a direction opposite from anticipation
* Temporal discounting is the tendency to value the present more than the future.
* Anticipation and temporal discounting pull us in different directions until an equilibrium is reached
* When the value obtained from anticipating a future reward is greater than the value of consuming the reward at present, we will delay our indulgence.
* when our desire to have the gourmet Swiss chocolate is greater than the joy of savoring it, we will tear into the wrapper.
* In 2005, the savings rate in the United States was negative for the first time since the 1930s.
* Michael, like many others, had a difficult time imagining himself at the age of seventy
* Even if we manage, with some effort, to imagine our aging selves, most people find the image aversive.
* Alas, thinking about retirement funds involves thinking about aging
* As we would rather avoid the thought altogether, many of us shun planning our financial future.
* After making a difficult choice between two equally valued options, such as between two desirable job offers or vacation destinations, people subsequently value the selected alternative more strongly than they initially had, and the discarded one less so
* Brehm may have become unpopular with the local female population; however, from that point on he was well recognized by psychologists around the world. His experiment, known as the free-choice paradigm, was replicated hundreds of times, and the idea that our actions alter our preferences has since been supported by large sets of data. Some of the most intriguing work in the field was done on very special participants—hairy creatures with a fondness for bananas and nuts, also known as capuchin monkeys. Laurie Santos, a professor of comparative and evolutionary psychology, runs a monkey lab at Yale University. Her aim is to explore whether aspects of human behavior that many of us consider uniquely human are, in fact, exclusive to humans, or whether they are rooted instead in our hairy ancestors.
* hippocampus is a brain structure in the medial temporal lobe that is important for the formation and consolidation of memories that can be consciously retrieved
* we do not need to consciously remember that we made a choice in order for that choice to change our preferences
* The interesting point is that in order for us to value something more after committing to it, we have to be the ones making the decision
* If someone else makes the choice for us, the change in value is not observed.
* If you would like to increase your employees’ commitment to your company, your students’ commitment to their studies, your clients’ appreciation of the service you are providing, remind them every so often of their freedom of choice
* when you select something—even if it is a hypothetical choice, even if it is something you already have, even if you had not really picked it but just believe you did—you will value it more.
* As time passes, the sense of ownership of the decision may evaporate, and a need to make a new one may emerge.
* To explain this, the psychologist Leon Festinger introduced what was to become one of the most prominent theories in psychology—cognitive dissonance theory.9 According to this theory, having to make a choice between two similarly desirable alternatives triggers psychological discomfort. This is because the decision conflicts with the desirable aspects of the rejected alternative, and with the undesirable aspects of the selected alternative. If you make up your mind to purchase a Mini Cooper over a family car, that decision clashes with the fact that the family car has room for your kids, while the Mini Cooper does not. According to cognitive dissonance theory, by reevaluating the options postchoice, in a way that is consistent with your decision, reduces psychological tension. So after sealing the deal on the Mini Cooper, you may say to yourself that the car will make you feel young, that it will be easy to park in the city, and that it is environmentally friendly compared with the large family car.
* having to make a choice between two similarly desirable alternatives triggers psychological discomfort
* According to cognitive dissonance theory, by reevaluating the options postchoice, in a way that is consistent with your decision, reduces psychological tension
* There are competing hypotheses to cognitive dissonance theory. The chief one is known as self-perception theory.10 According to this theory, people infer their preferences by observing their choices. In other words, I can conclude that if I purchased the red pumps, that must mean I prefer them to the black pumps. I might not even remember why I settled on the flashy shoes. Nevertheless, the fact that I just spent a nice sum of money on them must mean I like them a lot. From the fact that the other pair is still on the shelf, I conclude that I did not want them as much. The result? My evaluation of the chosen red pumps is boosted and that of the rejected black pumps is lowered.
* on average, activity recorded by an fMRI scanner can indicate with a precision that is higher than chance which choices participants are likely to make.
* If we were not inclined to update the value of our options rapidly so that they concur with our choices, we would likely second-guess ourselves to the point of insanity.
* Consistently second-guessing ourselves would interfere with our daily functioning and promote a negative effect.
* On the other hand, reevaluating our alternatives after making a decision increases our commitment to the action taken and keeps us moving forward.
* Neisser’s groundbreaking study showed that flashbulb memories are not so much Polaroid photos as snapshots brushed up in Photoshop again and again. T
* The retouched photo might resemble the original image, but it is no longer an exact representation of what was initially captured.
* Many salient events had taken place throughout my years in New York City, but that brief moment at 10:28 a.m on September 11, 2001, stands out in particular in my mind: the tower collapsing, the people around me crying out in shock, the man on my right-hand side, the lady across the street in a purple dress, the clouds of dust, and the warm sun. In the words of the “godfather” of experimental psychology, William James, “An impression may be so exciting emotionally almost to leave a scar upon the cerebral tissues.”5 This seemed to be the case. Or was it?
* Flashbulb memories are not more accurate than “regular” memories, but they certainly seem so.
* amygdala is especially important for expressing fear, as well as for learning about dangerous stimuli.
* monkeys with lesions in the medial temporal lobe (where the amygdala sits) no longer seemed to be afraid of anything much
* When it comes to our recollections, it is critical that we have vivid memories of the good, the bad, and the ugly—even if these do not provide perfect replicas of the events being recalled. A child needs to remember the terrible burning sensation felt when touching a hot oven so that he does not attempt to grab a muffin (or was it a bun?) from inside an oven again. A vivid memory of failing an exam drives us to study harder to ace the next one, and easily recalling past heartaches can help guide us in our next attempt at romance. Believing that we can use a negative past experience to learn and do better in the future may, in fact, fuel optimism. Optimistic people are not necessarily those with a positively biased view of the past; neither are they the ones holding a positively biased view of the present. They are the ones who see the future through rose-tinted glasses despite all the disappointing experiences they have had.

* The impact bias is our tendency to overrate the effect of an adverse outcome on our well-being.
* The human brain is an extremely flexible and adaptive piece of machinery
* The mind does better than simply adjust itself to new situations.
* In order to fully adapt, it creates new capabilities to compensate for those that have been lost.
* the caudate is a nucleus deep in the brain that is involved in signaling expectations of emotional outcome.
* Choosing to complete an embarrassing or physically demanding assignment conflicts with prior belief
* Such conflict, also known as cognitive dissonance, produces a negative arousal.
* s uncomfortable emotion can be reduced by biasing our perception of the environment
* Our brains comfortably change our perceptions of the physical world to suit our needs
* We will never see the same event and stimuli in exactly the same way at different times
* the world has grown suspicious of anything that looks like a happily married life
* What is puzzling is that we go about our daily business, experiencing both negative and positive events
* and yet we underestimate our likelihood of getting stuck in traffic, experiencing heartache, or being attacked by a war-seeking commander.
* Moderate optimism correlated with sensible decisions
* extreme optimism correlated with seemingly irrational decisions.
* optimism is like red wine: A glass a day is good for you, but a bottle a day can be hazardous.”
* Extreme optimism, like excessive drinking, can be dangerous not only for our health but for our pockets, too.
* In 1973, a decade after the original due date, the Sydney Opera House was completed. The cost was $102 million—more than fourteen times the original budget!
* There is a demonstrated, systematic, tendency for project appraisers to be overly optimistic.
* To redress this tendency appraisers should make explicit, empirically based adjustments to the estimates of a project’s costs, benefits, and duration.”
* When people imagine adverse situations, they see themselves getting out of the muddle
* Clearly, imagining how things may go wrong (being locked out of your apartment) can aid in identifying actions (giving a spare key to your neighbor) that will help us avoid adverse situations; it may also aid in preparing us emotionally for disappointment and heartache. However, pondering unpleasant events interferes with daily activities by promoting negative effects such as anxiety and depression.
* Although good things may transpire, on average our expectations exceed future outcomes.
* Like other illusions of the human brain, the optimism bias is not easily accessible for introspection
* our brains have evolved to overpredict future happiness and success, because, funnily enough, doing so makes health and progress more likely.
* The brain is organized in a hierarchical structure. It is this precise arrangement that allows our expectations to influence both our perception of reality and our actions—thereby altering reality itself. In this book, we have focused on structures at the apex of the brain’s hierarchy, such as the frontal cortex, and on evolutionarily older structures that are found lower down the ladder. As you might remember, the frontal cortex carries out higher cognitive functions, such as planning, abstract thinking, theory of mind (thinking about what others are thinking), error detection, and conflict resolution.5 Moving deeper into the brain, we find the subcortical regions. These include structures we have considered repeatedly throughout the book, such as the amygdala, which is involved in emotional processing,6 the hippocampus, which plays an important role in memory,7 and the striatum, which is key in representing the value of stimuli and actions.8
* It is tempting to speculate that optimism was selected for during evolution precisely because positive expectations enhance the probability of survival.
* The brain provides a distorted view of reality. It deceives, yes
* But it does so for a reason, and at the very same time it allows the realization that each of us is susceptible to illusions and biases.

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck
***********************************

*Mark Manson*  (4294969691)

* The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience.
* paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.
* You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of.
* You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.”
* Being open with your insecurities paradoxically makes you more confident and charismatic around others.
* These moments of non-fuckery are the moments that most define our lives
* To not give a fuck is to stare down life’s most terrifying and difficult challenges and still take action.
* Subtlety #1: Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.
* Subtlety #2: To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.
* The problem with people who hand out fucks like ice cream at a goddamn summer camp is that they don’t have anything more fuck-worthy to dedicate their fucks to.
* when a person has no problems, the mind automatically finds a way to invent some
* Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy.
* There is a premise that underlies a lot of our assumptions and beliefs. The premise is that happiness is algorithmic
* This premise, though, is the problem. Happiness is not a solvable equation.
* After all, the greatest truths in life are usually the most unpleasant to hear.
* We suffer for the simple reason that suffering is biologically useful. It is nature’s preferred agent for inspiring change
* And this pain, as much as we hate it, is useful
* Life is essentially an endless series of problem
* The solution to one problem is merely the creation of the next one.
* Problems never stop; they merely get exchanged and/or upgraded.
* Happiness comes from solving problems. The keyword here is “solving.”
* Happiness is therefore a form of action; it’s an activity, not something that is passively bestowed upon you,
* Happiness is a constant work-in-progress, because solving problems is a constant work-in-progress
* True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving.
* Highs come in many forms.
* Whether it’s a substance like alcohol, the moral righteousness that comes from blaming others, or the thrill of some new risky adventure, highs are shallow and unproductive ways to go about one’s life

* An obsession and overinvestment in emotion fails us for the simple reason that emotions never last
* Everything comes with an inherent sacrifice—whatever makes us feel good will also inevitably make us feel bad.
* your response is so common and expected that it doesn’t really mean anything.
* Joy doesn’t just sprout out of the ground like daisies and rainbows.
* What determines your success isn’t, “What do you want to enjoy?” The relevant question is, “What pain do you want to sustain?”
* I wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love with not the fight but only the victory.
* This is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes. Our problems birth our happiness, along with slightly better, slightly upgraded problems.
* And if you think at any point you’re allowed to stop climbing, I’m afraid you’re missing the point. Because the joy is in the climb itself.

* Self-awareness is like an onion.
* There are multiple layers to it, and the more you peel them back, the more likely you’re going to start crying at inappropriate times.
* The second layer of the self-awareness onion is an ability to ask why we feel certain emotions.
* The third level is our personal values: Why do I consider this to be success/failure
* Honest self-questioning is difficult
* It requires asking yourself simple questions that are uncomfortable to answer.
* In fact, in my experience, the more uncomfortable the answer, the more likely it is to be true.
* We think we’re all sophisticated with our toaster ovens and designer footwear, but we’re just a bunch of finely ornamented apes.
* And because we are apes, we instinctually measure ourselves against others and vie for status.
* If you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and/or how you measure failure/success.
* Pleasure is a false god.
* Pleasure is not the cause of happiness; rather, it is the effect.
* Our brains are inefficient machines.
* We consistently make poor assumptions, misjudge probabilities, misremember facts, give in to cognitive biases, and make decisions based on our emotional whims.

The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master
***************************************************

*Hunt, Andrew;Thomas, David*  (4294967887)

* What Makes a Pragmatic Programmer
* When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less."
* The greatest of all weaknesses is the fear of appearing weak.
* Pragmatic Programmer takes charge of his or her own career, and isn't afraid to admit ignorance or error
*  Instead of excuses, provide options
* Try to flush out the lame excuses before voicing them aloud
* Tip 3 Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses
* Tip 4 Don't Live with Broken Windows
* Tip 5 Be a Catalyst for Change
* Tip 6 Remember the Big Picture
* Your knowledge and experience are your most important professional assets. Unfortunately, they're expiring assets
* Tip 8 Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio
* Tip 9 Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear
* A good idea is an orphan without effective communication
* If possible, involve your readers with early drafts of your document. Get their feedback, and pick their brains. You'll build a good working relationship, and you'll probably produce a better document in the process.
* Tip 10 It's Both What You Say and the Way You Say It
* Giving a computer two contradictory pieces of knowledge was Captain James T. Kirk's preferred way of disabling a marauding artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, the same principle can be effective i
* EVERY PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE MUST HAVE A SINGLE, UNAMBIGUOUS, AUTHORITATIVE REPRESENTATION WITHIN A SYSTEM.
* keep the low-level knowledge in the code, where it belongs, and reserve the comments for other, high-level explanations
* All services offered by a module should be available through a uniform notation, which does not betray whether they are implemented through storage or through computation."
* shortcuts make for long delays
* If it isn't easy, people won't do it.
* Tip 11 DRY—Don't Repeat Yourself
* Tip 12 Make It Easy to Reuse
* Tip 13 Eliminate Effects Between Unrelated Things
* It is easier to write relatively small, self-contained components than a single large block of code.
* An orthogonal approach also promotes reuse
* There is a fairly subtle gain in productivity when you combine orthogonal components. Assume that one component does M distinct things and another does N things. If they are orthogonal and you combine
* start by separating infrastructure from application
* Don't rely on the properties of things you can't control.
* Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP),
* Building unit tests is itself an interesting test of orthogonality
* Orthogonality is closely related to the DRY principle introduced on page 27. With DRY, you're looking to minimize duplication within a system, whereas with orthogonality you reduce the interdependency among the system's components. It may be a clumsy word, but if you use the principle of orthogonality, combined closely with the DRY principle, you'll find that the systems you develop are more flexible, more understandable, and easier to debug, test, and maintain.
* Nothing is more dangerous than an idea if it's the only one you have.
* Tip 14 There Are No Final Decisions
* The classic response is to specify the system to death. Produce reams of paper itemizing every requirement, tying down every unknown, and constraining the environment. Fire the gun using dead reckonin
* Tip 15 Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target
* Tracer code is not disposable: you write it for keeps. It contains all the error checking, structuring, documentation, and self-checking that any piece of production code has. It simply is not fully functional
* A small body of code has low inertia—it is easy and quick to change. You'll be able to gather feedback on your application and generate a new, more accurate version faster and at less cost than with any other metho
* With a prototype, you're aiming to explore specific aspects of the final system. With a true prototype, you will throw away whatever you lashed together when trying out the concept, and recode it properly using the lessons you've learned.
* Prototyping generates disposable code. Tracer code is lean but complete, and forms part of the skeleton of the final system
* Before you embark on any code-based prototyping, make sure that everyone understands that you are writing disposable code
* The limits of language are the limits of one's world.
* Tip 17 Program Close to the Problem Domain
* By coding at a higher level of abstraction, you are free to concentrate on solving domain problems, and can ignore petty implementation details.
* Tip 18 Estimate to Avoid Surprises
*  One of the interesting things about estimating is that the units you use make a difference in the interpretation of the result
* choose the units of your answer to reflect the accuracy you intend to convey.
* basic estimating trick that always gives good answers: ask someone who's already done it.
* Tip 19 Iterate the Schedule with the Code
* It is a painful thingTo look at your own trouble and knowThat you yourself and no one else has made
* The easiest person to deceive is one's self
* You must brutally test both boundary conditions and realistic end-user usage patterns. You need to do this systematically
* But we want more than a bug that can be reproduced by following some long series of steps; we want a bug that can be reproduced with a single command. It's a lot harder to fix a bug if you have to go through 15 steps to get to the point where the bug shows up. Sometimes by forcing yourself to isolate the circumstances that display the bug, you'll even gain an insight on how to fix it.
* Rubber Ducking A very simple but particularly useful technique for finding the cause of a problem is simply to explain it to someone else
*  It is possible that a bug exists in the OS, the compiler, or a third-party product—but this should not be your first thought. It is much more likely that the bug exists in the application code under development.
* Tip 26 "select" Isn't Broken
* The amount of surprise you feel when something goes wrong is directly proportional to the amount of trust and faith you have in the code being run
* . That's why, when faced with a "surprising" failure, you must realize that one or more of your assumptions is w
* This is an interesting feature of passive code generators: they don't have to be totally accurate.

* Liskov Substitution Principle [Lis88]: Subclasses must be usable through the base class interface without the need for the user to know the difference.
* Loops are subject to the banana problem (I know how to spell "banana," but I don't know when to stop),
* Tip 32 Crash Early  Crash, Don't Trash
* A dead program normally does a lot less damage than a crippled one.
* There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves we feel no one else has a right to blame us.
* Tip 33 If It Can't Happen, Use Assertions to Ensure That It Won't
* Will this code still run if I remove all the exception handlers?" If the answer is "no," then maybe exceptions are being used in nonexceptional circumstances.
* Tip 34 Use Exceptions for Exceptional Problems
* Programs that use exceptions as part of their normal processing suffer from all the readability and maintainability problems of classic spaghetti code. These programs break encapsulation: routines and their callers are more tightly coupled via exception handling.
* Tip 35 Finish What You Start This tip is easy to apply in most circumstances. It simply means that the routine or object that allocates a resource should be responsible for deallocating it.
* Deallocate resources in the opposite order to that in which you allocate them. That way you won't orphan resources if one resource contains references to another.When allocating the same set of resou

* Law of Demeter for Functions
* Tip 36 Minimize Coupling Between Modules
* Studies have shown [BBM96] that classes in C++ with larger response sets are more prone to error than classes with smaller response sets (a response set is defined to be the number of functions directly invoked by methods of the class).
* No amount of genius can overcome a preoccupation with detail • Levy's Eighth Law
* Details mess up our pristine code—especially if they change frequently
* Tip 37 Configure, Don't Integrate
* Typically, metadata is accessed and used at runtime, not at compile time
* But we want to go beyond using metadata for simple preferences. We want to configure and drive the application via metadata as much as possible. Our goal is to think declaratively (specifying what is to be done, not how) and create highly dynamic and adaptable programs. We do this by adopting a general rule: program for the general case, and put the specifics somewhere else—outside the compiled code base.
* program for the general case, and put the specifics somewhere else—outside the compiled code base.
* Tip 38 Put Abstractions in Code, Details in Metadata
* A more flexible approach is to write programs that can reload their configuration while they're running
* Tip 40 Design Using Services Instead of components, we have really created services—independent, concurrent objects behind well-defined, consistent interfaces.
* Why is it bad to push all the events through a single routine? It violates object encapsulation—that one routine now has to have intimate knowledge of the interactions among many objects. It also increases the coupling—and we're trying to decrease coupling. Because the objects themselves have to have knowledge of these events as well, you are probably going to violate the DRY principle, orthogonality, and perhaps even sections of the Geneva Convention. You may have seen this kind of code—it is usually dominated by a huge case statement or multiway if-then. We can do better.
* Objects should be able to register to receive only the events they need, and should never be sent events they don't need
* Tip 42 Separate Views from Models
* Fred doesn't know why the code is failing because he didn't know why it worked in the first place. It seemed to work, given the limited "testing" that Fred did, but that was just a coincidence. Buoyed
* Why should you take the risk of messing with something that's working? Well, we can think of several reasons: It may not really be working—it might just look like it is.The boundary condition you re
* Assumptions that aren't based on well-established facts are the bane of all projects.
* Attempting to build an application you don't fully understand, or to use a technology you aren't familiar with, is an invitation to be misled by coincidences
* Don't just test your code, but test your assumptions as wel
* Don't let existing code dictate future code. All code can be replaced if it is no longer appropriate.
* Common Sense Estimation You can estimate the order of many basic algorithms using common sense.
* Pragmatic Programmers try to cover both the theoretical and practical bases.
* Tip 46 Test Your Estimates
* Well, software doesn't quite work that way. Rather than construction, software is more like gardening—it is more organic than concrete. You plant many things in a garden according to an initial plan and conditions. Some thrive, others are destined to end up as compost. You may move plantings relative to each other to take advantage of the interplay of light and shadow, wind and rain. Overgrown plants get split or pruned, and colors that clash may get moved to more aesthetically pleasing locations. You pull weeds, and you fertilize plantings that are in need of some extra help. You constantly monitor the health of the garden, and make adjustments (to the soil, the plants, the layout) as needed.
* Rewriting, reworking, and re-architecting code is collectively known as refactoring.
* Any number of things may cause code to qualify for refactoring: Duplication. You've discovered a violation of the DRY principle (The Evils of Duplication, page 26).Nonorthogonal design. You've disco
* think of the code that needs refactoring as a "growth." Removing it requires invasive surgery. You can go in now, and take it out while it is still small. Or, you could wait while it grows and spreads—but removing it then will be both more expensive and more dangerous. Wait even longer, and you may lose the patient entirely.
* Tip 47 Refactor Early, Refactor Often
* How Do You Refactor?
* Don't try to refactor and add functionality at the same time.Make sure you have good tests before you begin refactoring. Run the tests as often as possible. That way you will know quickly if your cha
* Mr. Fowler's point of maintaining good regression tests is the key to refactoring with confidence.
* When you design a module, or even a single routine, you should design both its contract and the code to test that contract. By designing code to pass a test and fulfill its contract, you may well consider boundary conditions and other issues that wouldn't occur to you otherwise. There's no better way to fix errors than by avoiding them in the first place. In fact, by building the tests before you implement the code, you get to try out the interface before you commit to it.
* By making the test code readily accessible, you are providing developers who may use your code with two invaluable resources: Examples of how to use all the functionality of your moduleA means to bu
* All software you write will be tested—if not by you and your team, then by the eventual users—so you might as well plan on testing it thoroughly. A little forethought can go a long way toward minimizing maintenance costs and help-desk calls.

* Of course, there isn't. The solution lies elsewhere. The secret to solving the puzzle is to identify the real (not imagined) constraints, and find a solution therein. Some constraints are absolute; others are merely preconceived notions. Absolute constraints must be honored, however distasteful or stupid they may appear to be. On the other hand, some apparent constraints may not be real constraints at all. For example, there's that old bar trick where you take a brand new, unopened champagne bottle and bet that you can drink beer out of it. The trick is to turn the bottle upside down, and pour a small quantity of beer in the hollow in the bottom of the bottle. Many software problems can be just as sneaky.

Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World.
********************************************************************

*Bruce Schneier*  (4294969370)

* When it comes to security, fear is the barrier between ignorance and  understanding. To get beyond fear, you have to start thinking intelligently about the trade-offs you make
* A common path to bad security is knee-jerk reactions to the news  of the day
* security is always a  trade-off, and to ignore or deny those trade-offs is to risk losing basic  freedoms and ways of life we now take for granted.
* Security is about preventing adverse consequences from the intentional and unwarranted actions of others
* ecurity concerns itself with intentional actions. This points to  an important distinction: Protecting assets from unintentional  actions is safety, not security
* safety is  often more important than security, since there are far more  unintentional unwarranted actions in the world than intentional  ones.
* Security requires the concept of an attacker who performs these  intentional and unwarranted actions
* Those intentional unwarranted actions are called attacks
* The objects of attack are assets
* often they are seduced by the  promise of technology.
* Technology is generally an enabler, allowing people to do things.  Security is the opposite: It tries to prevent something from happening,  or prevent people from doing something
* Step 1: What assets are you trying to protect?
* Step 2.• What are the risks to these assets?
* Step 3: How well does the security solution mitigate those risks
* This is not as simple as looking at the security solution and  seeing how well it works.
* Step 4: What other risks does the security solution cause
* Step 5: What costs and trade-offs does the security solution impose
* There is no single correct level of security; how much security you have depends on what  you're willing to give up in order to get it
* perfect, impregnable, completely foolproof security is a pipe dream, the stuff of fairy tales, like  living happily ever after
* A totally effective solution, certainly, but completely  impractical
* Because security always involves a trade-off, more security isn't  always better. You'd be more secure if you never left your home, but  what kind of life is that?
* A  threat is a potential way an attacker can attack a system
* When security professionals talk about risk, they take into consideration both the likelihood  of the threat and the seriousness of a successful attack.
* Risk management is about playing the odds
* We do this by looking at the risks, not the threats
* When someone says that the risks of nuclear power (for example)  are unacceptable, what he's really saying is that the effects of a nuclear  disaster, no matter how remote, are so unacceptable to him as to make  the trade-off intolerable
* For some people in some situations, the level of security is beside  the point. The only reasonable defense is not to have the offending  object in the first place
* Perceived risks can be wildly divergent  from actual risks compiled statistically
* People have trouble estimating risks for anything not exactly like  their normal situation
* Middle-class Americans can be particularly naive and complacent;  their lives are incredibly secure most of the time, so their instincts  about the risks of many situations have been dulled.
* People exaggerate spectacular but rare risks and downplay  common risks. Th
* When people voluntarily take  a risk, they tend to underestimate it. When they have no choice  but to take the risk, they tend to overestimate it.
* News, by definition, is about  anomalies. Endless numbers of automobile crashes hardly make  news like one airplane crash does.
* studies have shown that  both drivers and passengers in SUVs are more likely to die in accidents than those in compact cars, yet one of the major selling points of  SUVs is that the owner feels safer in one.
* This example illustrates the problem: People make security decisions based on perceived risks instead of actual risks, and that can  result in bad decisions
* We learn about risks, or we think  we are learning, not by directly experiencing the world around us and  by seeing what happens to others, but increasingly by getting our view  of things through the distorted lens of the media
* Movies also skew our intuition by presenting unreal scenarios. We  are led to believe that problems can be solved in less than two hours,  and that the hero can both stop the bad guys and get the girl in the  final ten minutes
* Conspiracy  theories are an irresistible labor-saving device in the face of complexity," says Harvard professor H.L. "Skip" Gates.
* Even theft is not necessarily a security problem if it does no harm and  the owner is not discomforted; in other words, the attack has to result  in what's agreed on as an "adverse consequence." Someone who walks  around a city park picking up litter is not a security problem.
* Comparing this to battery security is another story entirely. Nokia  spends about a hundred times more money per phone on battery security than on communications security
* It's important to understand security theater for what it is, but not  to minimize its value. Security theater scares off stupid attackers and  those who just don't want to take the risk
* cost of that decision is not borne by those making it.
* In economics, what is called an externality occurs when one player  makes a decision that affects another player
* Unless you understand the players and  their agendas, you will never understand why some security systems  take the shape they do.
* As some  engineers say, the issues ramify
* Life was simple before World War II. After that, we had systems.
* one system will come to interact with, and affect,  other systems in surprising ways. These interactions are called emergent properties of systems
* Because so often a successful security system looks as if  nothing ever happens, the only reliable way to measure security is to  examine how it fails-in the context of the assets and functionality it  is protecting.
* Most engineering involves making  systems work. Security engineering involves making sure systems don't  fail.
* It is the notion of an adversary that separates safety and security  engineering
* In order to think about  security, you need to think about how systems fail.
* Security usually fails at the seams-at the points where two systems interact
* The system fails to take action when it should. A security system can  also fail by doing what it's supposed to do, but at the wrong time.
* In most security systems, active failures are more frequent than  passive failures
* Systems with passive failures are simply less effective
* Systems with a  relatively high rate of active failures are almost always more trouble than they're worth because of the high rate of false alarms.
* Rarity is also often a cause of active failures
* Unbreakable," "absolute,"  "unforgeable," and "impenetrable" are all words that make no sense  when discussing security
* Also, people who had something and then  lost it are often less risk-averse than those who have much to lose
* The best way to look  at potential attackers is to make an effort of the imagination-as perilous as that may be-and to see matters from their perspective.
* Doing so isn't necessarily a disaster, but it is certainly  more likely to result in one.
* n general, opportunists are much easier to secure systems against,
* The common thread among these  attackers is that their internal reality doesn't square with what most of  us take to be objective realit
* -their attacks are statement attacks-and  their statements mostly make no sense to other
* Emotional attackers  are, as a rule, very hard to defend against.
* The right set of emotions can lead to any  level of risk tolerance.
* One of the major reasons the U.S. was reluctant to produce its evidence of Iraq's weapons programs  in 2002 and 2003 was the risk of compromising sources and methods.
* In trying to understand a terrorist's motivations, sometimes it is more useful to look at who has more to lose, not  who has more to gain.
* Suicide bombers are best thought of as part of the machine  used to execute the attack.
* There hasn't been a new crime invented in millennia. Murder, theft,  impersonation, counterfeiting-they are all perennial problems and  have been around since the beginning of society
* Identity theft is today's name for the crime of impersonation.
* The same technology that allows  a small company to compete with a multinational allows a scam Web  site to compete with a legitimate one.
* In 2001, some say there were over 500,000 cases  of identity theft in the U.S. alone.
* In creating large databases of information, whether government or corporate, we are opening ourselves to the possibility that  the databases will be subverted by attackers
* What this means is that you need to judge a risk based not only  on who is likely to attack the system and what they want, but on  exactly what assets are being attacked
* Try it yourself. The next time you dine in a restaurant, think of all  the ways you can eat a meal and then not pay
* We can't keep weapons out  of prisons, a much more restrictive and controlled environment. How can we have a  hope of keeping them off airplanes?
* technology will generally  favor the attacker, with the defender playing catch-up.
* Defenders benefit from technology all the time, just not as efficiently  and effectively as attackers do.
* Systems often look simple because their complexity remains  hidden
* complexity is terrifying. It leads to more and more subtle vulnerabilities. It leads to catastrophic failures, which are both harder to test for  beforehand and harder to diagnose afterward.
* As systems continue to get more complex, they will continue to  get less secure.
* Increasingly, people seem to misinterpret  complexity as sophistication, which is baffling-the incomprehensible  should cause suspicion rather than admiration."
* Complex systems have even more security problems when they are  nonsequential and tightly coupled
* As helpers mediate more and more interactions, the  complexity of the systems supporting those interactions increases dramatically. And so do the avenues of attack.
* metaphor shear"-the  technological complexities or unpalatable facts that we hide or smooth  over in the interests of functionality or easy understanding.
* Class breaks mean that you can be vulnerable simply because your  systems are the same as everyone else
* Yale economist Martin Shubik  has said that an important way to think about different periods in history is to chart the number of people ten determined men could kill  before being stopped. His claim is that the curve didn't vary throughout much of history, but it's risen steeply in the last few decades.
* when we make a technology generally available, we are trading off all  of the good uses of that technology against the few bad uses, and we  are risking unintended consequences
* It's the same with almost every technology: Automobiles, cryptography, computers, and fertilizer are all good for society,  but we have to accept that they will occasionally be misused.
* fast-moving technological advances generally favor attackers,  leaving defenders to play catch-up.
* technology "... is a queer  thing. It brings you great gifts with one hand, and it stabs you in the  back with the other."
* "A chain is no stronger than the weakest link
* Just as security is subjective, so is the weakest link. If you think you've  found the weakest link in a system, think again. Which weakest link did  you find? The one for a petty criminal? The one for organized crime?  The one for a terrorist? There might be one weakest link for an attacker  who is willing to kill, and another one for an attacker who is not
* Relying on a single security countermeasure-a  single silver bullet that may protect you absolutely-is a far riskier  strategy than relying on a series of countermeasures that can back each  other up if one fails-a hail of lead.
* Security is not just a matter of numerous countermeasures, but countermeasures that work independently and in series and that present  different sets of challenges to the attacker.
* The system failed badly: An initial failure in one system cascaded  into failures in other systems
* There are two  basic ways to overengineer a system. You can make it more redundant  than it needs to be, or you can give it greater capacity than it needs
* Compartmentalization is another way to help secure the weakest link  by avoiding single points of attack. The basic idea of compartmentalized security is to divide assets into smaller pieces and to secure them separately
* is  a kind of divide-to-defend strategy rather than divide and conquer
* Many attacks can be traced to a failure to apply the principle of  compartmentalization
* . In a compartmentalized computer network, a hacker's success against one part  doesn't automatically gain him access to the entire system
* But choke points work only if there's no way to get around them.
* Often  the most important part of an engineer's (and the whole profession's)  store of information is the knowledge of what doesn't work and in  exactly which circumstances
* More important than any security claims are  the credentials of the people making those claims.
* There's no way to prove the  security of a countermeasure or a system; it's only possible either to  demonstrate insecurity or to fail trying. In mathematics, this is called  proving the null hypothes
* Cut functionality to the bone. Eliminate options. Reduce interconnections with  other systems. There is no substitute for simplicity.
* Make one link  more secure, and another one suddenly becomes the weakest
* The Internet was originally designed as a medium by which  scientists could share information, not for the widespread commercial  use we are seeing today.
* Airports, train stations, and other transportation centers were originally designed to move the maximum number of people through them as efficiently as possible; now they must be  redeployed for the antithetical mission of being a front-line defense  against terrorists and drug runners.
* As late as the early 1970s,  people were able to take handguns and hunting rifles on planes with  them
* New Zealand added metal detection on its domestic flights after  9/11. The country didn't bother with it before because you can't hijack  a plane to anywhere: The islands are so remote that planes on domestic routes simply don't have enough fuel.
* the nature of their failure is important. Systems that fail  badly are brittle, and systems that fail well are resilient.
* All security systems fail sooner or later, but brittle security systems  fail badly. Break them at one point, and they break completely. Cause  a minor problem, and it turns into a major problem. Cause a major  problem, and it turns into a disaster.
* Current rates of fraud  in the U.S. are about 6 cents per $100 of transaction volume (down  from 7 cents in 1998 and 18 cents in 1992
* Static security works best against copycats who repeat the same  attacks over and over again; innovation, especially innovation caused  by technological advances such as rifles and railroads, requires  dynamic security
* As a  rule, homogeneous systems tend to be brittle because they are more  vulnerable to class breaks
* . Our society is built on mass  production; there's little true diversity in the systems that protect us.  (Yet homogeneity is good for interoperability, a classic trade-off.)
* this kind of behavior default to insecure: If the secure system  doesn't work, the system reverts to a less secure system, rather than  maintaining security by shutting down.
* Step 1: What assets are you trying to protect
* Step 2: What are the risks to those assets
* Step 3: How well does the security solution mitigate those risks
* Step 4: What other risks does the security solution cause
* Step 5: What trade-offs does the security solution require
* There won't be a  market for improved security unless people know about vulnerabilities and demand  solutions for them.
* When information  is kept secret, we as a society lose both the good and the bad uses of that information. This is a significant trade-off.
* To profile is to generalize. It's taking characteristics of a population  and applying them to an individual
* If those responsible for security  profile based on superstition and wrong-headed intuition, or by blindly  following a computerized profiling system, profiling won't work at all.
* The more trusted people a system employs, and the more we must  trust them, the more brittle it is.
* Trust is not black and white, meaning that someone is  either trusted or not.
* And trust is not monolithic, meaning that  trusted people are not all trusted to the same degree and in the same  contexts
* Think of a trusted  person as having a sphere of trust-a set of assets and functionality he  is trusted with. Make that sphere as small as possible.
* And when trust must be transitive, it creates brittleness.
* Automatic security  is necessarily flawed; only people can be dynamic and resourceful and  can recognize and respond to new threats and attacks.
* But when we replace people with technology, we lose their creativity, their ingenuity, and their adaptability. When we constrain  people so much that they become drones, we create the same effect
* "The strength of a wall depends on the courage of those who defend  it,
* Security is not about technology. It's about risks, and different  ways to manage those risks
* Prevention is the first and foremost role of any barrier.
* Prevention is best combined with detection and response.

Exodus: How Migration is Changing Our World
*******************************************

*Collier, Paul*  (4294969473)

* But in fact, we grasp at reasons and pull them into service to legitimize judgments that we have already made on the basis of our moral tastes
* Our ethics determine the reasoning and evidence that we are prepared to accept.
* Taboos save you from the need to cover your ears by constraining what is said.
* Whereas disputes about evidence can in principle be resolved by one party being forced to accept that it is mistaken, disagreements about values may be irresolvable
* We prefer to rely upon snap judgments, often based on our values. Most of the time such judgments are remarkably good approximations to the truth, but we over rely upon them
* e people who believe that poor people should be free to move to rich countries would likely be the first to oppose the right of rich people to move to poor countries
* While both the welcome and the opposition were manifestly self-serving, neither could reasonably be seen as racist: Poles happened to be white and Christian.
* Racialism is a belief in genetic differences between races: one for which there is no evidence.
* But it may not. Since race is correlated with other characteristics such as poverty, religion, and culture, it remains possible that any limitation on migration based on these criteria is viewed as the Trojan horse for racism. If so, then it is still not possible to have an open debate on migration. I only decided to write this book once I judged that it is indeed now possible to distinguish between the concepts of race, poverty, and culture. Racialism is a belief in genetic differences between races: one for which there is no evidence. Poverty is about income, not genetics: the persistence of mass poverty alongside the technology that can make ordinary people prosperous is the great scandal and challenge of our age. Cultures are not genetically inherited; they are fluid clusters of norms and habits that have important material consequences. A refusal to countenance racially based differences in behavior is a manifestation of human decency. A refusal to countenance culturally based differences in behavior would be a manifestation of blinkered denial of the obvious.
* Cultures are not genetically inherited; they are fluid clusters of norms and habits that have important material consequences
* the right to live anywhere is not a logical corollary of opposition to racism.
* If some people win while others lose, whose interest should prevail?
* The long march through these three different perspectives will provide the building blocks for an overall evaluation of migration. But to move from description to evaluation we need both an analytic and an ethical framework. In the typical work of advocacy on migration both the analytics and the ethics trivialize the problem because all the important effects appear to work in the same direction, with opposing effects being dismissed as “controversial,” “minor,” or “short term.” But any honest analysis must recognize that there are both winners and losers, and that even determining the overall effect on a particular group can be ambiguous, depending on how gains are measured against losses. If some people win while others lose, whose interest should prevail? Much economic analysis of migration comes to a clear and powerful answer: the winners gain much more than the losers lose, so hard luck on the losers. Even with the simple metric of monetary income, the gains far outweigh the losses. But economists usually move on from money to the more sophisticated concept of “utility,” and by this metric the overall gains from migration are even larger. For many economists that answer settles the matter: migration policy should be set so as to maximize global utility.
* social scientists have strained every muscle to show that migration is good for everyone.
* “Is migration bad or good?” The central message of this book is that this is the wrong question. Asking this question of migration is about as sensible as it would be to ask, “Is eating bad or good?” In both cases the pertinent question is not bad or good but how much is best. Some migration is almost certainly better than no migration. But just as eating too much can lead to obesity, so migration can be excessive.
* ordinary people handle complexity through narratives: readily digestible theories-in-miniature.
* President Clinton famously won an election campaign on the slogan “It’s the economy, stupid
* Sustained cooperation depends upon trust.
* High-trust societies are better able to cooperate and also face lower costs of transactions because they are less dependent upon processes of formal enforcement.
* One reason poor countries are poor is that they are short of effective organizations: many are too small to reap scale economies, and many, especially among the public organizations, fail to motivate their workers
* Economists have long realized that big is productive: large organizations are able to reap economies of scale.
* For thousands of years until the twentieth century ordinary people were poor, everywhere. A high living standard was the privilege of extractive elites rather than the normal reward for productive work
* I will refer to the combination of institutions, rules, norms, and organizations of a country as its social model. Even among high-income countries social models differ considerably. America has particularly strong institutions and private organizations, but somewhat weaker public organizations than Europe, and Japan has much stronger norms of trust than either of them. But though they differ in detail, all high-income societies have social models that function remarkably well. Quite possibly, different combinations work well because the components adapt so as to fit each other: for example, institutions and norms may gradually evolve so as to be well suited given the state of narratives and organizations. But such adaptation is not automatic. On the contrary, hundreds of different societies existed for thousands of years before any of them happened upon a social model capable of supporting the ascent to prosperity. Even the Glorious Revolution was not undertaken with the objective of unleashing prosperity: it was triggered by a mixture of religious prejudice and political opportunism. The English social model that emerged in the eighteenth century was replicated and improved in America. This in turn influenced social revolution in France, which exported its new institutions by force of arms across western Europe. The key point I wish to convey is that the present prosperity enjoyed in the Western world, and which is belatedly spreading more widely, is not the outcome of some inevitable march of progress. For thousands of years until the twentieth century ordinary people were poor, everywhere. A high living standard was the privilege of extractive elites rather than the normal reward for productive work. Had it not been for a fortuitous combination of circumstances that relatively recently produced a social model conducive to growth, this dreary state of affairs would most likely have continued. In poor countries it continues still.
* The cultures—or norms and narratives—of poor societies, along with their institutions and organizations, stand suspected of being the primary cause of their poverty.
* assertions of multiculturalism: if a decent living standard is something to be valued, then on this criterion not all cultures are equal.
* the pertinent concept of the diaspora is defined not by birth but by behavior.
* one straightforward influence on the absorption rate: it depends directly upon the size of the diaspora itself.
* Have the consequences of migration been bad or good?” is concrete and entirely meaningful, it is as irrelevant as asking, “Should you have been born?”
* the answer to “How much?” hinges upon how rapidly migrants merge with the indigenous society.
* Those who have had the good fortune to ascend a ladder should not haul it up after them. But whether this is an appropriate analogy for migration depends upon context.
* But diversity also brings problems.
* The gains from greater variety are subject to diminishing returns:
* like most aspects of consumption, each extra unit confers fewer extra benefits
* Cooperation games are fragile because if pushed too far they collapse.
* trust and cooperation beyond the family are acquired as part of the functional attitudes that accumulate in a modern prosperous society.
* it is not possible for Nigerians to get life insurance. This is because, given the opportunism of the relevant professions, a death certificate can be purchased without the inconvenience of dying.
* differences in the rule of law can be traced yet further back to the difference between moralities based on loyalty to the honor of the clan, and moralities based on the Enlightenment concept of good citizenship
* Migrants bring not only the human capital generated in their own societies; they also bring the moral codes of their own societies.
* but instead began to absorb the norms of the diplomatic community.
* diplomats from high-corruption countries continued not to pay fines, whereas those from low-corruption countries became less likely to pay
* People in all societies manage mutual regard for their families, and usually also for their local communities, but the distinctive feature of the high-income societies is that mutual regard embraces a much larger group of people, namely fellow citizens.
* I doubt that in any of the high-income societies migration has to date significantly jeopardized the mosaic of cooperation games.
* Indeed, there is now mounting evidence that the opposite happens: the children of immigrants are more resistant to adopting the national culture than are their parents
* something described as a role model is usually implied to be good, whereas something described as a stereotype is usually implied to be bad. But what they have in common is the idea that they are ready-made identities.
* Popular culture is a menu of readily downloadable stereotypes
* there is ample evidence that repeated exposure to violence through the media reduces inhibitions to violent behavior.
* A growing group of people with low levels of trust can be destabilizing. If the number of people playing opportunistic rather than cooperative strategies accumulates, it may no longer be sensible for other people to continue to play cooperative strategies. The vital ingredient of successful cooperation is that enough people should be willing to punish those who do not cooperate. But if those who adopt opportunistic rather than cooperative strategies are disproportionately immigrants, punishment may become misconstrued as discrimination, making people more reluctant to punish. Further, other members of the immigrant group might misconstrue punishment of opportunism as discrimination against their group and themselves punish those who punish to enforce cooperation: recall that these are the “supervillains” in cooperation games who most effectively cause cooperation to collapse.
* The vital ingredient of successful cooperation is that enough people should be willing to punish those who do not cooperate.
* other members of the immigrant group might misconstrue punishment of opportunism as discrimination against their group and themselves punish those who punish to enforce cooperation
* the greater the proportion of immigrants in a community, the lower were mutual levels of trust between immigrants and the indigenous population.
* In other words, far from proximity leading to greater mutual understanding, it leads to heightened mutual suspicion.
* However, Putnam went on to a completely new result that is far more troubling. The higher the level of immigration in a community, the lower the trust was not just between groups but within them. A high level of immigration was associated with a lower level of trust of each other purely among the indigenous people in the community. As would be expected from the importance of trust in fostering cooperation, the lower level of trust manifested itself in many different forms of reduced cooperation. Putnam refers to this effect as “hunkering down”: indigenous people living in a high-immigrant community retreat into themselves, trusting less and taking less part in social activities, having fewer friends, and watching more television. I have described Putnam’s results as if they were merely simple correlations between the level of immigration in a community and the level of trust. Were this the case his work would be open to a myriad of statistical objections. But Putnam is a highly professional researcher who has carefully investigated and controlled for a wide range of spurious possible explanations for his results. All social science is open to challenge, and given that Putnam’s results were politically anathema for many social scientists, it was inevitable that his results would be contested. While they may turn out to be misleading, they should not be dismissed. Despite Putnam’s evident discomfort with the results, as he says, “it would be unfortunate if a politically correct progressivism were to deny the reality of the challenge to social solidarity posed by diversity.”16

* European countries are more cohesive than the United States, and their norms reflect this greater cohesion.
* But whereas theories can only be read with what Daniel Kahneman terms “slow” thinking, stories trigger “fast” thinking reactions
* Recall that the key prediction of Putnam’s work is that the decline in cooperation induced by immigration extends to the internal behavior of the indigenous community. The key damaging effect is not that immigrants and the indigenous population do not trust each other; it is that indigenous people lose trust in each other and so resort to opportunistic behavior. What happened in the aftermath of the Duggan incident may illustrate this breakdown in the restraints on opportunism within the indigenous population. The Duggan protests metastasized into looting that spread across the country, conducted by many thousands of teenagers from the indigenous population. The behavior was, as far as we can tell, utterly apolitical. Indeed, public buildings were ignored. The targets were shopping centers, where teenagers smashed windows and gleefully stole the standard accoutrements of teenage life. The behavior was also unrelated to ethnicity: essentially, indigenous teenagers looted from indigenous shops. Such behavior by indigenous teenagers was without precedent. In part, it was accounted for not by cultural change but by technological advance: teenagers, being particularly IT-savvy, were able to coordinate looting on their mobile phones, thereby achieving the safety of numbers. The police response also came in for criticism: having been accused of being too aggressive in the Duggan case, in the riots they were accused of being too passive. But police response to criminal behavior is less revealing than the behavior itself. The looting can reasonably be seen as reflecting a decline in social capital within the indigenous population.
* Anecdotes are not analysis: they merely illustrate what analysis is trying to show
* So, working from anecdote, we could stack up whatever apparent support for whatever story we find appealing. For this reason, it is not a valid means of analysis: rather, it is the stuff of opinionated advocacy.
* Empathy comes from a shared sense of identity. A
* As predicted by the theory, the greater the level of cultural diversity, the worse the provision of redistributive public goods.
* As with diversity and cooperation, particular cases merely have the status of illustrative anecdotes: with that caveat, exhibit A is California. Due to the conjunction of geography and opportunity, California has the highest incidence of immigrants of all American states. All these immigrants have arrived in the past fifty years, because until the 1960s America had a closed door. Most of California’s immigrants cluster in the lower range of the income distribution. So, according to the theory, California has precisely the preconditions for a growing reluctance on the part of high-income groups to pay for redistribution. California is an immensely rich state: it can certainly afford redistribution. For example, it is home to Silicon Valley. But its most distinctive feature in recent decades has been the collapse of its public services. The schooling system in California has plummeted down the American league tables and is now comparable to Alabama, at the very bottom. The public universities, once world-class institutions, have been starved of funding. In part, the collapse in public services is a consequence of a change in spending priorities away from redistribution toward prisons. California used to educate its poor, whereas now it jails them. But the core of the problem is not the composition of spending but the lack of revenue. Despite its prosperity, California is acutely short of revenue because of a tax strike by higher income groups who succeeded in placing a cap on property taxes. Given the scale of the problem in California, it would be foolish to attribute it to any one cause. However, a plausible contributing factor is that mass immigration has undermined the empathy of fortunate indigenes for poor people. Perhaps in previous times those Californians who were well off saw the less well off as people like themselves who had had less good fortune, whereas now they see them as a distinct group to which neither they nor their children belong.
* the purpose of a good model is not to do our thinking for us, but to provide supporting scaffolding that enables our understanding to reach further than we could achieve by unaided reasoning.
* While the first implication is intuitively obvious, this second one—that the rate of migration of the culturally more distant group will be permanently higher—is decidedly not obvious. Indeed, the opposite might have been the intuitive expectation. The model shows why intuition is wrong. So we get the paradoxical result that for a given income gap between countries of origin and a host country, the sustained migration rate will be greater the more culturally distant is the country of origin from the host country. As far as I can tell, this result has not previously been known. If that is so, then it vindicates why a model is valuable. Recall that the purpose of a good model is not to do our thinking for us, but to provide supporting scaffolding that enables our understanding to reach further than we could achieve by unaided reasoning.
* Diasporas reduce the costs of migration, and so the larger the diaspora from a country of origin, the higher will be the rate of migration from it
* popular cultures can be thought of as menus of downloadable stereotypes
* Around 1810 the term most frequently used in newspapers was “emigrants.” But by 1830, “emigrants” had given way to a new term, “settlers.
* Settlers not only bring their own agendas, but they also bring their own culture
* culture is, par excellence, a public good: something that everyone values but no one in particular is rewarded for sustaining
* in economic terms, not all cultures are equal.
* The contrast between French and British policies toward immigrant cultural practices as exemplified by veil wearing illustrates the lack of coherence. Veil wearing quite literally destroys mutual regard. In France this was widely recognized as being incompatible with fraternity and so veil wearing was banned. The ban was supported by both communists and the mainstream Right. In Britain, while some politicians across the political spectrum lamented the increase in veil wearing, all parties defined it as an issue of liberty from government interference. But, as the French decision indicates, the liberty to destroy fraternity need not be considered a human right. A consequence of these differences in policy choices is that although Britain has a much smaller Muslim population than France, veil wearing is increasingly common, whereas in France it is nonexistent.
* since migrants were already fortunate to have gained a windfall in their private income, there is little reason to transfer a disproportionate share of social housing to them.
* The ethical case against equal rights for groups is that to avoid second-class status each individual immigrant should have precisely the same rights as an individual indigenous person. If migrants are needier than the indigenous, then needs-based criteria should indeed grant greater access to excludable social housing. However, the second-class-citizen argument applied at the individual level itself has limits. As I discussed in chapter 3, the provision of public goods such as social housing depends upon the maintenance of a myriad of cooperative games. Although citizenship is a legal concept, to have moral force it must be grounded in some deeper notion of mutual regard. Citizenship is neither primarily about entitlements to government benefits nor about obligations to respect the law: it is about attitudes toward others. The continued provision of public goods depends upon both migrants and the indigenous population adopting the same attitude of mutual regard as the indigenous population has toward its own members. If the preservation of cultural difference is regarded as an individual right despite its potential threat to public goods, there is a tension between this right to difference and an individual right to the social housing that the indigenous culture has made possible. Whether this principle of group-based rights is seen as ethically reasonable turns out to be a matter of considerable moment, and I return to it in chapter 6.
* A recent estimate for Britain by the Office of Budgetary Responsibility is that house prices are around 10 percent higher due to migration.
* in London around 70 percent of elite housing is now being bought by migrants.
* However, the mere fact that a society is aging is not a reason to need extra workers
* Over a longer period the British Medical Association, the country’s politely named trades union for doctors, has limited the supply of doctors (ostensibly to maintain standards, more plausibly to produce the scarcity that would justify high wages). As a result, British doctors are among the highest paid in Europe.
* What is good for business is not necessarily good for indigenous people. The short-term interest of business is for the open door: it is cheaper to recruit already-skilled migrants than to train indigenous youth, and the pool of talent will be wider when the door is more open
* A visit to Dubai is a stark and unsettling reminder of global inequality precisely because, by design, the business model attracts the world’s extremes of income. The superrich come to stay in the luxury hotels and the superpoor come to work in them.
* In America the Obama administration has sustained expulsion rates at around 400,000 per year.
* he found that the effects on happiness were dominated by social costs: the higher the concentration of immigrants in a community, the less happy was the indigenous population, controlling for other characteristics.
* Happiness studies find that social relations are far more important than small changes in income, and “hunkering down” is essentially an erosion of these relations.
* the productivity gap is either due to the characteristics of workers or to the characteristics of countries. Economists have studied this issue, and the bulk of the gap is due to differences in the characteristics of countries rather than the people in them.
* most, though not all, differences in income between rich and poor countries are because of differences in productivity that are due to characteristics of countries rather than of individual workers. T
* Whether or not migrants realize it, the impetus for their emigration is to escape from those aspects of their countries of origin that have condemned people to low productivity
* We find that the rate of migration from a country of origin to any particular host country is influenced by not just the income gap between them but the income of the host country relative to other possible host countries.
* Those migrants who expect to earn below-average incomes should prefer countries with high redistributive taxation, whereas those who expect to earn above-average incomes should prefer countries that accept greater inequality.
* Modern productivity is built on the back of past street demonstrations and protests that cracked the power of self-serving, extractive elites. So the windfall gains from migration are attributable ultimately to the public capital that has been built by the indigenous population
* While the fact that someone has migrated is reasonable evidence that he wanted to do so, the fact that someone has not migrated cannot be interpreted as evidence that he does not wish to do so
* Finance constraints give rise to an apparent paradox: an increase in income in the country of origin can actually increase emigration from it.
* Economists inhabit a rather chilling world in which people act only on their rational self-interest.
* in poor societies where overall trust levels are low, families function as islands of high trust.
* Families in poor countries are the mirror image of companies in rich ones.
* this may have been driven more by the need for gestures than by a well-reasoned case.
* Illegal migrants to the United States are deported in very large numbers: in 2011 a remarkable 400,000. T
* NOW IT IS TIME FOR THE SURPRISING STAGE: why are migrants also the big losers from migration? The answer is that those who have already migrated lose, at least in economic terms, from the subsequent migration of others. They lose because the argument that migrants compete with low-wage indigenous labor, which I reviewed and substantially dismissed in chapter 4, contains a grain of truth. Migrants seldom compete head-to-head with indigenous workers, because, through a combination of tacit knowledge, accumulated experience, and discrimination, indigenous workers have a substantial advantage over migrants. Migrants compete head-to-head not with low-skill indigenous workers but with each other.
* contrary to the hope that exposure increases tolerance, the opposite appears to happen
* The indigenous population is more tolerant of low numbers than of high numbers
* Research finds that above a modest income threshold increases in income do not generate sustained increases in happiness,
* According to the economics of happiness, the first few thousand dollars would increase happiness, but the remainder would be slack.
* Migration does not deliver the anticipated free lunch, or rather the free lunch comes at the price of indigestion.
* The miracle of economic prosperity is at source about social models: the fortuitous combination of institutions, narratives, norms, and organizations that in the eighteenth century began to lift Britain, and subsequently many other countries, out of the poverty that had persisted for millennia. Ultimately, the effect of migration on conditions in the bottom billion depends upon how it affects the social models prevalent in these countries. A critical aspect of the social model, recently emphasized by Acemoglu and Robinson (2011), is the shift in political power from extractive elites to more inclusive government that empowers the productive. So the opening chapter of this part focuses on the effects of migration on the politics of countries of origin, rather than the more conventional concern with brain drain and remittances, which I deal with in the next chapter.
* migration of the talented young provides bad regimes with a safety value
* Is migration causing governance to deteriorate, is bad governance driving people out, or is poverty causing both?
* The degree of democracy is a very crude metric for the quality of governance:
* The macroanalysis is in its infancy and may remain there. One long-established measure of governance is the degree to which a country is democratic, measured year by year for many countries. The degree of democracy is a very crude metric for the quality of governance: incumbent rulers are often able to manipulate elections so that they meet the appearance of legitimacy without threatening their power. Or politics becomes so corrupted by money that voters face a pointless choice between rival crooks. China, which avoids elections, is better governed than the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which, despite its name and its contested elections, is mired in corrupt and ineffective rule. But nevertheless, other things being equal, more democracy is likely to trump less democracy. The analysis of democracy evidently suffers from the same problems as any other aspect of governance. But according to the best macroanalysis currently available the net effect of migration is ambiguous, depending upon its composition and the scale of the brain drain.2 The migration of the unskilled unambiguously makes countries somewhat more democratic. However, given the trends in the migration policies of high-income countries, the more pertinent issue is the migration of the skilled. Unfortunately, the emigration of the skilled has two potentially opposing effects on the pressure for democracy. Although migration builds a diaspora that brings external pressure, it may drain the stock of educated people. This matters because the greater the proportion of the population that is educated, the stronger the pressure for democracy. Where the brain drain predominates, which unfortunately is what happens in most of the small, poor countries, although migrants bring external pressure for political reform, they have depleted the resident pressure brought by the educated. Research has as yet been unable to resolve this ambiguity: the macro approach leaves us in the dark.
* The migration of the unskilled unambiguously makes countries somewhat more democratic.

Procrastination
***************

*Jane B. Burka*  (4294969522)

* At its core, problem procrastination is a problem with one’s relationship to oneself,
* One cause can be put to rest: research has shown that intelligence bears no relationship to procrastination,7 so you can forget the idea that you’re putting things off until your brilliance kicks in, or that being a procrastinator means you’re stupid. Men procrastinate only slightly more than women, and there is evidence that procrastination abates as we get older. Perhaps people don’t want to waste the time they have left, or they have stepped off the competitive escalator, or maybe they are finally comfortable with who they are and what they’ve accomplished—or not.
* you can forget the idea that you’re putting things off until your brilliance kicks in,
* or that being a procrastinator means you’re stupid.
* One way to tell whether procrastination is a problem for you is whether you find it troublesome.
* As one procrastinator put it, “I have the experience of constant lament.”
* Sometimes distracting activity seems so productive that you actually believe you are making progress on The  Project
* When you play  the perilous game of brinksmanship, you no longer have the luxury of extra time to plan, refine, or improve what’s done.
* In short, success is defined in terms of perfection.
* Self-worth = Ability = Performance
* However ability may be defined, a problem occurs when it is the sole determinant of one’s self-worth.
* It is more tolerable to blame themselves for being disorganized, lazy, or uncooperative than to view themselves as being inadequate and unworthy—the failure they fear so deeply.
* It’s not how high your standards are that makes you a maladaptive perfectionist;
* it’s how far below your standards you perceive your performance to be, how unrealistic and inhibiting your standards are for you,
* and how harshly you judge yourself for not meeting them.
* Self-handicapping is a backhanded way to protect your ego and your self-esteem
* I lost, but I did it to myself.
* going after perfection is like chasing the horizon: you keep going, but you can never really get there.
* Procrastination protects people from taking a risk that might result in failure,
* which from a Fixed Mindset perspective would be a life sentence of inadequacy.
* Failures may hurt or disappoint, but they don’t define a person.
* “Is success about learning—or proving you’re smart?”
* success as “the timely pursuit of your intentions.
* Caught between a desire to assimilate and loyalty to their heritage
* By delaying, procrastinators appear to be disinterested in competitive struggles
* Success is like an escalator. Once you get on, there’s no place to get off except at the top.”
* It feels like I’m gaining an education but losing my family
* it’s a dog-eat-dog world, and as the dogs get bigger, the bites get worse.
* just because you fear something doesn’t mean it’s true now and forever.
* Without realizing it, you may be using your procrastination to assert your independence.
* As one procrastinator said, “The rules of mortal men do not apply to me.”
* The Ultimate Battle. The most profound of all battles-by-procrastination is the battle against reality. Some of us are simply unwilling to accept that what is, is. We can’t stand limits; we can’t stand that we can’t control other people; we can’t stand that we’re not going to be rescued. Sometimes people invent how they think things should be and then live according to their vision, as if it were reality. Lindsay, a computer programmer, had trouble keeping jobs. She came late and left early. She asked a lot of questions of her coworkers and manager rather than take the time to figure out solutions for herself. When she started a temporary job, she assumed she would be kept on permanently without having to work hard to prove herself. Recently, Lindsay applied for a job that required knowledge of a computer language she didn’t have, but she figured they would train her on the job. After all, it was obvious that she was smart and a quick learner, so she shouldn’t have to bother spending her time and money to take courses to upgrade her skills. Lindsay spent money as if she already  had her next job instead of accepting the limitations of living on unemployment checks. The word “budget” was not in her vocabulary, but “Can you lend me money until I get a job?” was. People were always telling Lindsay to “get real,” and Lindsay’s response was, “I hate reality.” She clung to her version of how things should be and procrastinated on dealing with things as they were. Some people just cannot accept the facts of their situations, and their procrastination is a fight against a reality they don’t like.
* Some people just cannot accept the facts of their situations,
* and their procrastination is a fight against a reality they don’t like.
* if you interpret someone else’s strength as automatically meaning that you are weak, you are exaggerating the other’s power in your own  mind.
* Cooperation Is the Same As Capitulation
* Thwarting My Opponent Is More Important Than Getting What I Want
* If you are compelled to fight every battle that comes along, you are not truly free or powerful
* To be truly free, you must be able to choose which battles to fight and which to cede.
* As long as people currently in your life seem to echo people from your past, you don’t really ever separate from those early relationships
* Many procrastinators live within their own versions of the passage of time,
* often, the procrastinator’s ideas about time do not match “clock time.”
* Many procrastinators live with a profound conflict between subjective time and objective time
* unwilling or unable to recognize that their version of time can be very different from clock time
* Your subjective sense of time seems so much an integral part of who you are that it may be difficult to accept that it is a personal perspective
* It is a losing battle to try to get someone else to adopt your subjective sense of time
* Acceptance of the past might bring peace instead of despair or self-criticism.
* It might even be liberating to feel freed from having to chase the unattainable
* It is essentially disorienting not to be able to tell the difference between the finite and the infinite.
* A sense of timelessness makes it hard to recognize the link between past, present, and future not only in time but also in ourselves.19 Procrastinators desperately want to believe in a future that has nothing to do with past problems. You may not want to recognize that the “you” who procrastinated last time is the very same “you” who has a project deadline this time. You may want to forget the feelings of dread, anxiety, and pressure you felt last time and assume instead that  the New You will sail through the current project feeling capable and inspired.
* Memories of past  glories or fantasies of future success can function as a soothing buffer against the pain of real life or a stalled life.
* Your past is your past, whether you like it or not, whether you remember it consciously or not
* whether you take responsibility for it or not.
* u can’t go back and change them, even if they feel unfinished and unfair.
* What is Mature Time? We see it as the “capacity to assess and accept what is real in both the external and internal worlds,”23 the acknowledgment and acceptance of both clock time and subjective time, and the ability to move flexibly and comfortably between the two. Clock time doesn’t have to be your enemy or your boss. Time is neither good nor bad, neither fast nor slow, neither friend nor foe. It just is. Your job is to figure out how to work with it and to live as fully as you can within its bounds, rather than spend your life battling against it.
* Your job is to figure out how to work with it and to live as fully as you can within its bounds, rather than spend your life battling against it.
* Your feelings may be conscious, such as when you are aware of why a task is aversive: “Balancing my checkbook is boring”; “I hate to spend my time cleaning”; “I don’t understand algebra.” However, “much of what the brain does during an emotion occurs outside of conscious awareness.”12 It is widely accepted in cognitive neuroscience today that “consciousness is a very limited part of the mind,”13 so it’s to be expected that there are a lot of times when you are not consciously aware of the feelings that lead you to avoid a project. Even if you don’t know exactly which emotions are happening outside of your conscious awareness, your body is reacting.
* The more you do something, the more your brain responds to support that activity;
* it learns to do what is asked of it faster and better (whether it’s good for you or not).
* In addition, your body holds onto fear
* In addition, your body holds onto fear. Once your brain makes a connection between a stimulus (for example, a snake, a term paper, a presentation to your executive team) and a feeling of danger or fear, that connection cannot be extinguished.16 After just a single exposure to a threatening stimulus, fear can be reactivated whenever that stimulus is encountered again, even if you don’t remember it.17 A famous case in neuroscience illustrates how fear can be experienced unconsciously without being understood by the conscious mind. In 1911, a patient with brain damage couldn’t remember her past. Every day when she met her doctor, she had no memory of ever having seen him before. One day he concealed a pin in his hand, and when they  shook hands on greeting, he pricked her outstretched hand. Subsequently, every time he attempted to shake hands, she refused, even though she could not explain her aversion. The traces of the past painful experience remained in her brain and exerted a powerful unconscious influence on her behavior.18 You may recognize yourself in this example—you don’t know why you avoid a particular task, but you avoid it every time. The link between the original stimulus and your fear is now unconscious.
* fears that don’t make sense at face value are not necessarily “irrational
* they make their own kind of sense.
* “The things we are afraid of are the things that have already happened.”
* chronic stress makes it harder to remember and harder to think clearly
* Terror, shame, guilt, disgust, and self-hate are often by-products of old memories
* Research confirms that low self-esteem contributes to procrastination
* Treating yourself with kindness will stimulate this part of your brain (the “left shift”
* creating a state  that is correlated with feelings of resilience and well-being.
* If you can’t grasp that you exist in time, preparing for and taking care of yourself in relation to the future seems irrelevant.
* when we live in a chronically stressed way, our bodies are constantly producing stress hormones
* which over time, damage important brain structures.
* Stress is magnified when we procrastinate.
* It’s a vicious circle: procrastination produces stress, and stress can produce procrastination
* Knowing the ebbs and flows of your own biological states will help you act in harmony with your body rather than constantly fight against what is natural for you
* Whatever your struggles with procrastination, there is always a biological component to what you experience
* When the assumptions and rules we learned in our families automatically govern our thoughts, feelings, and behavior, without our evaluating or challenging them, we can be headed for trouble, particularly if the rule is a very rigid one that inhibits our development as capable, creative individuals. It’s like eating everything that is put on your plate without ever considering whether you like it, whether it’s good for you, or even whether you’re hungry! You just open your mouth and swallow, causing psychic indigestion.
* It’s like eating everything that is put on your plate without ever considering whether you like it, whether it’s good for you, or even whether you’re hungry!
* You may not realize that most people will accept your normal human limitations more than you are accustomed to expect.
* In one sense, procrastination has served you well
* It has protected you from what may be some unpleasant realizations about yourself.
* regardless of the reasons for your procrastination, and in spite of whatever “comfort” it has given you, you have also paid a price for it.
* As Mark Twain said, “Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear—not absence of fear.”
* Carl Jung said, “The most terrifying thing is to accept oneself completely
* Our areas of brain weakness can get us into trouble if we deny them or if we hate ourselves for having them, but accepting them has important advantages
* When you notice feelings of hesitation, discomfort, or anxiety that usually lead to procrastination, you have an opportunity to get to know yourself better,
* Remember that the signals from the fear center of the brain to the thinking part of the brain move very rapidly
* whereas the pathways from the thinking part to the fear center are much slower,
* so don’t expect to calm yourself as quickly or as thoroughly as you became overwhelmed.
* Accepting yourself as you are also means getting real about your values
* “A goal is a destination. A value is a direction for living.”
* If you are putting off things that would move you along your chosen direction for living, then procrastination is interfering with the fullest expression of who you are
* A healthy system is one that is coherent and integrated, neither too rigid nor too chaotic
* we suggest you pick a goal that is realistic, achievable, and easily measured
* People usually resist when something feels uncomfortable
* It is rare to find a procrastinator who puts things off in every area of his life
* Many excuses have a kernel of truth
* The point is that, even if there is some truth to your excuse, the function of the excuse is to avoid discomfort
* We were taking such a broad view of our purpose that it was antithetical to  making progress.
* A behavioral goal has the following characteristics:
* • it is observable by you and others;• it is specific and concrete;• it can be broken down into small steps;• the first step can be accomplished in just five minutes.
* Most procrastinators think only about “being there” and have a hard time thinking about “getting there.

Paper Promises
**************

*Philip Coggan*  (4294969587)

* In many Western countries, the total value of debt is three to four times the value of annual economic output.
* paper money is about as solid as air miles; the kind of currency that you accumulate but can never really cash in.
* As Keynes pointed out, money saved, rather than spent, reduces demand for goods and thus employment
* Inflation penalizes the thrifty
* Money is not the value for which goods are exchanged but the value by which they are exchanged’,
* Money is the belief that someone will pay you back.
* So this is our first monetary use, as a ‘medium of exchange’.
* The second use of money is as a ‘unit of account
* The third use of money is as a ‘store of value
* All the gold that has ever been mined will fit into a cube smaller than a typical tennis court.
* If, in an ideal world, you want the supply of money to grow in line with the economy, gold and silver alone won’t do
* When the last link between gold and paper currencies was dropped in 1971, bullion traded at $35 an ounce; by mid-2011, the price was $1,900. In gold terms, therefore, the dollar had lost 98 per cent of its value. It is progress of a kind. The Romans took two hundred years to devalue their currency by the same amount; our generation has achieved the trick in just forty years.
* Sweden was the first European country to issue paper money,
* Goodhart’s Law’, which was that any economic variable was doomed to misbehave as soon as it was targeted. It was like pinning jelly to the wall.
* In boom times, money and money-like assets multiply, as the medium of exchange function dominates. But in bad times, people start to worry more about money as a store of value; in other words, as a claim on wealth
* One of the risks that the global economy now faces is that central banks will make the same mistakes as the Imperial Chinese, Confederate and Weimar Republic governments did before them
* return should not be greater than the economic return on the asset against which it is lent.
* It did not make sense to borrow money to finance immediate consumption
* Having to defer gratification was a way of instilling self-discipline
* The French national debt tripled between 1774 and 1789, with the result that interest payments consumed half the budget. A crop failure in 1785 increased political discontent while the state’s financial difficulties forced the king to call the Estates General (the French parliament) in 1789, starting the process that led to revolution
* In the nineteenth century, for example, the Austro-Hungarian Empire defaulted or rescheduled its debt five times.
* An 1839 Supreme Court judgment declared that ‘the right to issue bank notes was at common law an occupation open to all men’
* The granting of a loan requires both the creditor and the debtor to be confident that the latter’s income will grow sufficiently to repay the debt
* This is a problem of deferred gratification. But the creditor has to be sure that the debtor will be able to repay, so the system still depends on the prospect of growth.
* So we now had economic growth and population growth. The next stage emerged as workers gathered in factories. Initially, the conditions were terrible – long hours, low pay (albeit better than a farm labourer’s income) and non-existent safety standards. In the crowded towns, sanitation was poor, disease spread quickly and life expectancy was severely restricted. But factories made a big difference in that they grouped workers together and made it easier for them to organize in their own interest. That was very difficult for geographically dispersed agricultural workers. Steadily over the nineteenth century, trade unions grew in membership and workers flexed their muscles through strikes. Governments started to recognize their power and buy them off. Bismarck, a hard-headed pragmatist, introduced old-age pensions in  Germany as a way of recruiting worker support for the Hohenzollern monarchy.
* By the mid 2000s, the financing arms of General Motors, Ford and General Electric were among the largest, and most profitable, parts of the companies’ business.
* fact is that debt and money are two sides, not of the same coin, but of the same bank note. That would not be true of a currency consisting entirely of precious metal. Such metals have one defining characteristic: they are no one else’s liability.
* Floating rates have been favoured by those whose priority is economic expansion, rather than stable prices.1
* countries can choose two out of three options, but not all three. Those options are a fixed exchange rate, free capital movements, and national control of the level of interest rates.
* Like a bank, the gold standard essentially depended on confidence.
* When Baring Brothers, what was then called a merchant bank, came close to failure in 1890, the Bank of England had to borrow gold from France and Russia in the face of a run on its reserves.
* the Reichsbank in Germany borrowed money from Britain and France in 1898
* By and large, sound money backed by gold was a policy that favoured the governing elite. ‘The ability of the rich and their acolytes to see social virtue in what serves their interest and convenience, and to depict as ridiculous or foolish what does not, was never better  manifested than in their support of gold and condemnation of paper money,’ wrote the economist J. K. Galbraith .7
* In retrospect, world economies entered a thirty-year ‘dark age’ after 1914, roughly equivalent to the chaos that followed the collapse of the Roman Empire
* the broken window syndrome; breaking windows may create work for glaziers but we cannot achieve prosperity by smashing all the windows in our houses.
* In 1914, the dollar was worth 4.2 marks. After the war, which Germany had financed through money-printing, the dollar was worth 65 marks. By August 1923, a dollar could buy 620,000 marks, and by November 630 billion.
* politicians were not to be trusted with paper money, any more than an alcoholic should be left in charge of the drinks cabinet
* French gold reserves quadrupled between 1926 and 1931.
* By the late 1920s, Germany faced a particular credibility problem. More than half the deposits in German banks were held by foreigners
* In 1931, the Austrian bank Credit Anstalt went bust, ironically in part because it had been forced to take over a loss-making rival, the Bodencreditnastalt, in 1929. A run on all Austrian banks duly followed and in a classic case of contagion, the crisis spread to German banks.
* Trade restrictions started even before the Wall Street crash of 1929. Commodity prices started to fall sharply in 1928, in part because the US’s long boom had encouraged overcapacity. Stockpiles of wheat doubled between 1925 and 1929.
* The Great Depression was not a short-lived affair, like the economic downturn of 1920 – 21, but a prolonged journey.
* In 1931, forty-seven countries were on the gold standard; by the end of 1932, there were just eleven.

* ly government can take perfectly good paper, cover it with perfectly good ink and make the combination worthless.’Milton Friedman
* With the demise of Bretton Woods, money was free of its link to gold, the ‘barbarous relic’ as Keynes had described it. In the ancient battle between creditors and debtors, this was a victory for the latter and, as we shall see in the next chapter, it led to an explosion in the amount of debt. In the battle to define money, it was also a victory for those who believed its primary function was as a medium of exchange, not as a store of value. Paper money has no intrinsic value
* The decision to save might make sense at the individual level but proved to be disastrous at the aggregate level at a time when business confidence was weak.
* it seems clear that countries are much better off if they attract what is known as foreign direct investment (factories, call centres and the like) rather than bank deposits
* At its simplest, a fall in a nation’s currency represents a fall in its standard of living; the citizen’s money will go less far
* The ‘one size fits all’ monetary policy led to interest rates that were too low for some countries, creating property booms in both Ireland and Spain.
* Stock market bubbles don’t grow out of thin air. They have a solid basis in reality, but reality as distorted by a misconception.’
* Debt-fuelled booms all too often provide false affirmation of a government’s policies, a financial institution’s ability to make outsized profits or a country’s standard of living. Most of these booms end badly
* Would house prices be ‘worth’ more in such a scenario? At the simple level, yes; an asset is worth what people are prepared to pay for it. Even at a more sophisticated level, one might say that citizens had made a conscious decision to devote more of their expenditure to home ownership. But in no sense could a society be called richer because house prices had risen due to laxer lending standards
* But even pyramid markets based on a genuine social change (such as the creation of the Internet) are doomed to eventual failure.
* I can calculate the motions of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people
* Real house prices were constant for around a century before jumping suddenly in the late 1990
* House prices are not directly included in the consumer price index (although a version of housing costs, known as owner-equivalent rent, is in the index).
* Charles Kindleberger, a great historian of bubbles, used the Minsky model to examine everything from tulip mania in the seventeenth century to John Law’s system and the Asian crisis of the late 1990s. He showed they followed a template of a ‘displacement’ – some development like a war or technological change – credit expansion, over-trading (the final speculative phase), followed by distress (as some investors try to exit) and revulsion, as all who took part are berated for their stupidity. The sub-prime boom fits the pattern.
* without credit expansion, it is hard to generate asset bubbles
* The railways were as exotic then as the Internet seemed in the late 1990s, and investors believed the prospects for profits were limitless. The mania only collapsed when it was clear that many lines lacked sufficient passengers to make them profitable.
* In 1982, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was no higher than it had been in 1965, even though economic activity was much greater.
* Investors learned an important lesson from this crisis. If asset markets fell far and fast enough, central banks would ride to the rescue
* The system of money and credit creation that emerged after 1971 was like a game of whack-a-mole. The money created was bound to pop up somewhere
* People who worked in the US financial sector actually earned less than those with similar qualifications in different professions in the late 1970s. It was only in the 1980s – and in particular the 1990s – that their  wages took off. Meanwhile the finance sector’s share of US GDP doubled, rising from 4 per cent in the 1970s to 8 per cent in 2007 – 08. Bank assets and profits were also rising relatively rapidly over this period.
* In 1973, for example, the average American chief executive earned 27 times the pay of the average worker; by 2005, the ratio was 262.2 The fruits of economic growth went almost exclusively to the rich. The real wage of the US worker grew by just 11% over the thirty-five years from 1966 to 2001 or 0.3% a year; the wages of the top 0.1% of the population grew by 3.4% a year over the same period.3 In 1990, the wealthiest 1% of the population had a 12% share of overall income. By 2007, their share had risen to 17%.
* The financial system is not at risk when a small bank fails, but a large bank failure is a real problem. It makes sense, therefore, for banks to get as big as possible since they can earn a greater benefit from the government guarantee. The industry duly became more concentrated. According to Andrew Haldane, the share of total assets of the top four US banks rose from 10% in 1990 to 40% in 2007
* Greenspan displayed ‘asymmetric ignorance’; he knew when markets were too low but not when they were too high.

* What made CDSs controversial is that investors did not need to own the bond to insure against its default
* The details may seem forbiddingly complex, but what toppled so many banks and a giant insurance company was, at heart, a simple problem. The financial system had accumulated a series of claims on America’s housing stock. These claims were collectively worth far more  than the houses themselves. Once that became clear, the value of some of these claims had to be wiped out. The crisis of 2007 – 08 was simply a mad scramble as investors tried to offload the claims. But, by definition, not everyone could do so. Like a game of Old Maid, the losers were the ones left holding the wrong card.
* Some countries have too little consumer debt. In Russia, for example, mortgage debt is just 3 per cent of GDP
* But there is an element of rationality about credit-card use. Academics point out that, although shopkeepers pay a fee to credit-card issuers, they do not charge differential rates for cash buyers. Instead, merchants increase the prices they charge to reflect the fees they pay  credit-card issuers. The effect is that cash buyers are subsidizing the card users. One study found that each American cash-using householder pays $149 a year to each card-using household.4 Since card use tends to be related to household income, this is a transfer of wealth from poor to rich; low-income households (those earning less than $20,000 a year) pay $21 a year each while those earning more than $150,000 a year get nearly $750 a year of subsidy.

Man and His Symbols
*******************

*Carl Gustav Jung*  (4294967847)

* the dream is not a kind of standardized cryptogram that can be decoded by a glossary of symbol meanings
* With the infallible (but often meaningless) logic of the algebraic equation, they argue from assumed premises to incontestably deduced conclusions.
* a word or an image is symbolic when it implies something more than its obvious and immediate meaning
* When, with all our intellectual limitations, we call something “divine,” we have merely given it a name, which may be based on a creed, but never on factual evidence.
* Consciousness is a very recent acquisition of nature, and it is still in an “experimental” state. It is frail, menaced by specific dangers, and easily injured.
* neurotic symptoms—hysteria, certain types of pain, and abnormal behavior—are in fact symbolically meaningful. They are one way in which the unconscious mind expresses itself
* A story told by the conscious mind has a beginning, a development, and an end, but the same is not true of a dream. Its dimensions in time and space are quite different; to understand it you must examine it from every aspect—just as you may take an unknown object in your hands and turn it over and over until you are familiar with every detail of its shape.
* only the material that is clearly and visibly part of a dream should be used in interpreting it.
* “misoneism,” a deep and superstitious fear of novelty.
* The two fundamental points in dealing with dreams are these: First, the dream should be treated as a fact, about which one must make no previous assumption except that it somehow makes sense; and second, the dream is a specific expression of the unconscious.
* As Nietzsche remarked, where pride is insistent enough, memory prefers to give way.
* Many people mistakenly overestimate the role of will power and think that nothing can happen to their minds that they do not decide and intend.
* Each word means something slightly different to each person, even among those who share the same cultural background.
* And the difference of meaning is naturally greatest when people have widely different social, political, religious, or psychological experiences.
* twisted it into a grotesque travesty of my meaning
* We have lost it to such a degree that we do not recognize it when we meet it again
* In fact, the terrors that stem from our elaborate civilization may be far more threatening than those that primitive people attribute to demons.
* The malign influence of evil spirits is at least an admissible hypothesis in a primitive culture, but it is a shattering experience for a civilized person to admit that his troubles are nothing more than a foolish prank of the imagination
* The general function of dreams is to try to restore our psychological balance by producing dream material that re-establishes, in a subtle way, the total psychic equilibrium.
* grandiose plans out of proportion to their real capacities
* Thus, dreams may sometimes announce certain situations long before they actually happen. This is not necessarily a miracle or a form of precognition. Many crises in our lives have a long unconscious history. We move toward them step by step, unaware of the dangers that are accumulating. But what we consciously fail to see is frequently perceived by our unconscious, which can pass the information on through dreams
* For the sake of mental stability and even physiological health, the unconscious and the conscious must be integrally connected and thus move on parallel lines
* No dream symbol can be separated from the individual who dreams it, and there is no definite or straightforward interpretation of any dream.
* The sign is always less than the concept it represents, while a symbol always stands for something more than its obvious and immediate meaning.
* The individual is the only reality. The further we move away from the individual toward abstract ideas about Homo sapiens, the more likely we are to fall into error. In these times of social upheaval and rapid change, it is desirable to know much more than we do about the individual human being, for so much depends upon his mental and moral qualities. But if we are to see things in their right perspective, we need to understand the past of man as well as his present. That is why an understanding of myths and symbols is of essential importance.
* there are a surprising number of individuals who never use their minds if they can avoid it, and an equal number who do use their minds, but in an amazingly stupid way.
* In so far as intuition is a “hunch,” it is not the product of a voluntary act; it is rather an involuntary event, which depends upon different external or internal circumstances instead of an act of judgment.
* These four functional types correspond to the obvious means by which consciousness obtains its orientation to experience. Sensation (i.e., sense perception) tells you that something exists; thinking t
* Thus, if you want to understand another person’s dream, you have to sacrifice your own predilections and suppress your prejudices
* Hobnobbing with Napoleon and being on speaking terms with Alexander the Great are exactly the kind of fantasies produced by an inferiority complex
* What we properly call instincts are physiological urges, and are perceived by the senses.
* Logical analysis is the prerogative of consciousness; we select with reason and knowledge. The unconscious, however, seems to be guided chiefly by instinctive trends, represented by corresponding thought forms—that is, by the archetypes
* But while personal complexes never produce more than a personal bias, archetypes create myths, religions, and philosophies that influence and characterize whole nations and epochs of history.
* The fact is that in former times men did not reflect upon their symbols; they lived them and were unconsciously animated by their meaning.
* The motto “Where there’s a will, there’s a way” is the superstition of modern man.
* pays the price in a remarkable lack of introspection
* His gods and demons have not disappeared at all; they have merely got new names
* What we call civilized consciousness has steadily separated itself from the basic instincts
* A man likes to believe that he is the master of his soul. But as long as he is unable to control his moods and emotions, or to be conscious of the myriad secret ways in which unconscious factors insinuate themselves into his arrangements and decisions, he is certainly not his own master
* man’s real life consists of a complex of inexorable opposites—day and night, birth and death, happiness and misery, good and evil.
* While life runs smoothly without religion, the loss remains as good as unnoticed. But when suffering comes, it is another matter. That is when people begin to seek a way out and to reflect about the meaning of life and its bewildering and painful experiences.
* A sense of a wider meaning to one’s existence is what raises a man beyond mere getting and spending
* Even a man of high intellect can go badly astray for lack of intuition or feeling.
* The safe basis of real intellectual knowledge and moral understanding gets lost if one is content with the vague satisfaction of having understood by “hunch.”
* Our times have demonstrated what it means for the gates of the underworld to be opened. Things whose enormity nobody could have imagined in the idyllic harmlessness of the first decade of our century have happened and have turned our world upside down. Ever since, the world has remained in a state of schizophrenia. Not only has civilized Germany disgorged its terrible primitivity, but Russia is also ruled by it, and Africa has been set on fire. No wonder that the Western world feels uneasy.
* The power as well as the glory is drained out of such once-potent words
* To be more accurate, the surface of our world seems to be cleansed of all superstitious and irrational elements. Whether, however, the real inner human world (not our wish-fulfilling fiction about it) is also freed from primitivity is another question
* Modern man is in fact a curious mixture of characteristics acquired over the long ages of his mental development
* it is essential to insist that they are not mere names, or even philosophical concepts. They are pieces of life itself—images that are integrally connected to the living individual by the bridge of the emotions. That is why it is impossible to give an arbitrary (or universal) interpretation of any archetype
* The mere use of words is futile when you do not know what they stand for
* As the evolution of the embryonic body repeats its prehistory, so the mind also develops through a series of prehistoric stages
* because thinking and feeling are so diametrically opposed that thinking almost automatically throws out feeling values and vice versa
* In spite of our proud domination of nature, we are still her victims, for we have not even learned to control our own nature.
* Slowly but, it appears, inevitably, we are courting disaster.
* There are no longer any gods whom we can invoke to help us
* It remains quite natural for men to quarrel and to struggle for superiority over one another. How then have we “conquered nature”?
* In wartime, for instance, one finds increased interest in the works of Homer, Shakespeare, or Tolstoi, and we read with a new understanding those passages that give war its enduring (or “archetypal”) meaning
* These hero myths vary enormously in detail, but the more closely one examines them the more one sees that structurally they are very similar. They have, that is to say, a universal pattern, even though they were developed by groups or individuals without any direct cultural contact with each other—by, for instance, tribes of Africans or North American Indians, or the Greeks, or the Incas of Peru. Over and over again one hears a tale describing a hero’s miraculous but humble birth, his early proof of superhuman strength, his rapid rise to prominence or power, his triumphant struggle with the forces of evil, his fallibility to the sin of pride (hybris), and his fall through betrayal or a “heroic” sacrifice that ends in his death.
* the essential function of the heroic myth is the development of the individual’s ego-consciousness—his awareness of his own strengths and weaknesses—in a manner that will equip him for the arduous tasks with which life confronts him.
* o and shadow, indeed, although separate, are inextricably linked together in much the same way that thought and feeling are related to each other.
* As a general rule it can be said that the need for hero symbols arises when the ego needs strengthening—when, that is to say, the conscious mind needs assistance in some task that it cannot accomplish unaided or without drawing on the sources of strength that lie in the unconscious mind.
* he should give up scaling mountains to prove his strength and submit to the meaningful ritual of an initiatory change that could fit
* If their lives have been adventurous, insecure, or full of change, they may long for a settled life and the consolations of religious certainty. But if they have lived chiefly within the social pattern in which they were born, they may desperately need a liberating change. This need may be filled, temporarily, by a trip around the world, or by nothing more than a move to a smaller house. But none of these external changes will serve unless there has been some inner transcendence of old values in creating, not just inventing, a new pattern of life.
* it is only the specific forms of these archaic patterns that change, not their psychic meaning.
* But the rites do not offer this opportunity invariably, or automatically. They relate to particular phases in the life of an individual, or of a group, and unless they are properly understood and translated into a new way of life, the moment can pass. Initiation is, essentially, a process that begins with a rite of submission, followed by a period of containment, and then by a further rite of liberation.
* uncontaminated by our civilized ideas and still have natural insight into the essence
* Strictly speaking, however, the process of individuation is real only if the individual is aware of it and consciously makes a living connection with it.
* it is necessary to give up the utilitarian attitude of conscious planning in order to make way for the inner growth of the personality
* Although we do see the shadow in a person of the opposite sex, we are usually much less annoyed by it and can more easily pardon it
* In dreams and myths, therefore, the shadow appears as a person of the same sex as that of the dreamer
* Obviously, the problem of the shadow plays a great role in all political conflicts. If the man who had this dream had not been sensible about his shadow problem, he could easily have identified the desperate Frenchman with the “dangerous Communists” of outer life, or the official plus the prosperous man with the “grasping capitalists.” In this way he would have avoided seeing that he had within him such warring elements. If people observe serve their own unconscious tendencies in other people, this is called a “projection.” Political agitation in all countries is full of such projections, just as much as the backyard gossip of little groups and individuals. Projections of all kinds obscure our view of our fellow men, spoiling its objectivity, and thus spoiling all possibility of genuine human relationships.
* the shadow is not necessarily always an opponent. In fact, he is exactly like any human being with whom one has to get along, sometimes by giving in, sometimes by resisting, sometimes by giving love—whatever the situation requires. The shadow becomes hostile only when he is ignored or misunderstood.
* Somewhere, right at the bottom of one’s own being, one generally does know where one should go and what one should do. But there are times when the clown we call “I” behaves in such a distracting fash
* In its individual manifestation the character of a man’s anima is as a rule shaped by his mother. If he feels that his mother had a negative influence on him, his anima will often express itself in irritable, depressed moods, uncertainty, insecurity, and touchiness
* One of the favorite themes that the animus repeats endlessly in the ruminations of this kind of woman goes like this: “The only thing in the world that I want is love—and he doesn’t love me”; or “In this situation there are only two possibilities—and both are equally bad.” (The animus never believes in exceptions.) One can rarely contradict an animus opinion because it is usually right in a general way; yet it seldom seems to fit the individual situation. It is apt to be an opinion that seems reasonable but beside the point.
* The animus, just like the anima, exhibits four stages of development. He first appears as a personification of mere physical power—for instance, as an athletic champion or “muscle man.” In the next st
* Nowadays more and more people, especially those who live in large cities, suffer from a terrible emptiness and boredom, as if they are waiting for something that never arrives. Movies and television,
* Old Chinese texts that are concerned with this kind of experience often use the simile of the cat watching the mousehole. One text says that one should allow no other thoughts to intrude, but one’s attention should not be too sharp—nor should it be too dull
* There are two reasons why man loses contact with the regulating center of his soul. One of them is that some single instinctive drive or emotional image can carry him into a one-sidedness that makes him lose his balance. This also happens to animals; for example, a sexually excited stag will completely forget hunger and security. This one-sidedness and consequent loss of balance are much dreaded by primitives, who call it “loss of soul.” Another threat to the inner balance comes from excessive daydreaming, which in a secret way usually circles around particular complexes. In fact, daydreams arise just because they connect a man with his complexes; at the same time they threaten the concentration and continuity of his consciousness.
* The second obstacle is exactly the opposite, and is due to an over-consolidation of ego-consciousness. Although a disciplined consciousness is necessary for the performance of civilized activities (we know what happens if a railway signalman lapses into daydreaming), it has the serious disadvantage that it is apt to block the reception of impulses and messages coming from the center
* the process of individuation excludes any parrot-like imitation of others. Time and again in all countries people have tried to copy
* o follow in the steps of a great spiritual leader does not mean that one should copy and act out the pattern of the individuation process made by his life.
* In order to understand the symbolic indications of the unconscious, one must be careful not to get outside oneself or “beside oneself,” but to stay emotionally within oneself
* We know from studying the social behavior of the higher animals that small groups (from approximately 10 to 50 individuals) create the best possible living conditions for the single animal as well as for the group, and man seems to be no exception in this respect
* statistics do no justice to the individual.
* In itself, an animal is neither good nor evil; it is a piece of nature. It cannot desire anything that is not in its nature. To put this another way, it obeys its instincts. These instincts often seem mysterious to us, but they have their parallel in human life: The foundation of human nature is instinct.
* Primitive man must tame the animal in himself and make it his helpful companion; civilized man must heal the animal in himself and make it his friend.
* a true symbol appears only when there is a need to express what thought cannot think or what is only divined or felt
* Fascination arises when the unconscious has been moved
* The laws of cause and effect have become valid only up to a certain point.
* Marc wrote: “Have we not learned from a thousand years of experience that things cease to speak the more we hold up to them the visual mirror of their appearance?
* But, as Sir Herbert Read remarks in his Concise History of Modern Art, metaphysical anxiety is no longer only Germanic and northern; it now characterizes the whole of the modern world. Read quotes Klee, who wrote in his Diary at the beginning of 1915: “The more horrifying this world becomes (as it is in these days) the more art becomes abstract; while a world at peace produces realistic art.” To Franz Marc, abstraction offered a refuge from the evil and ugliness in this world. “Very early in life I felt that man was ugly. The animals seemed to be more lovely and pure, yet even among them I discovered so much that was revolting and hideous that my painting became more and more schematic and abstract.”
* Envy, lust, sensuality, lies, and all known vices are the negative, “dark” aspect of the unconscious, which can manifest itself in two ways. In the positive sense, it appears as a “spirit of nature,” creatively animating man, things, and the world. It is the “chthonic spirit” that has been mentioned so often in this chapter. In the negative sense, the unconscious (that same spirit) manifests itself as a spirit of evil, as a drive to destroy.

* Berners-Lee’s initial motivation was to serve a community of physicists, not the whole world.
* Little programs are delightful to write in isolation, but the process of maintaining large-scale software is always miserable
* If it’s important to find the edge of mystery, to ponder the things that can’t quite be defined—or rendered into a digital standard—then we will have to perpetually seek out entirely new ideas and objects, abandoning old ones like musical notes
* Files are now part of life; we teach the idea of a file to computer science students as if it were part of nature.
* Technology Criticism Shouldn’t Be Left to the Luddites
* At the core was a sweet faith in human nature. If we empowered individuals, we believed, more good than harm would result.
* The way the internet has gone sour since then is truly perverse. The central faith of the web’s early design has been superseded by a different faith in the centrality of imaginary entities epitomized by the idea that the internet as a whole is coming alive and turning into a superhuman creature.
* Voluntary productivity had to be commoditized, because the type of faith I’m criticizing thrives when you can pretend that computers do everything and people do nothing.
* A self-proclaimed materialist movement that attempts to base itself on science starts to look like a religion rather quickly.
* Emphasizing the crowd means deemphasizing individual humans in the design of society, and when you ask people not to be people, they revert to bad moblike behaviors. This leads not only to empowered trolls, but to a generally unfriendly and unconstructive online world.
* Finance was transformed by computing clouds. Success in finance became increasingly about manipulating the cloud at the expense of sound financial principles.
* Pop culture has entered into a nostalgic malaise. Online culture is dominated by trivial mashups of the culture that existed before the onset of mashups, and by fandom responding to the dwindling outposts of centralized mass media. It is a culture of reaction without action.
* As long as you are not defined by software, you are helping to broaden the identity of the ideas that will get locked in for future generations. In most arenas of human expression, it’s fine for a person to love the medium they are given to work in. Love paint if you are a painter; love a But in the case of digital creative materials, like MIDI, UNIX, or even the World Wide Web, it’s a good idea to be skeptical.
* Singularity books are as common in a computer science department as Rapture images are in an evangelical bookstore.
* The Rapture and the Singularity share one thing in common: they can never be verified by the living.
* The digital hive is growing at the expense of individuality.
* Kevin Kelly says that we don’t need authors anymore, that all the ideas of the world, all the fragments that used to be assembled into coherent books by identifiable authors, can be combined into one single, global book
* Wired editor Chris Anderson proposes that science should no longer seek theories that scientists can understand, because the digital cloud will understand them better anyway.
* Information of the kind that purportedly wants to be free is nothing but a shadow of our own minds, and wants nothing on its own. It will not suffer if it doesn’t get what it wants
* But the Turing test cuts both ways. You can’t tell if a machine has gotten smarter or if you’ve just lowered your own standards of intelligence to such a degree that the machine seems smart
* We have repeatedly demonstrated our species’ bottomless ability to lower our standards to make information technology look good. Every instance of intelligence in a machine is ambiguous.
* Wikipedia, for instance, works on what I call the Oracle illusion, in which knowledge of the human authorship of a text is suppressed in order to give the text superhuman validity. Traditional holy books work in precisely the same way and present many of the same problems.
* If the Deep Blue team had not been as good at the software problem, a computer would still have become the world champion at some later date, thanks to sheer brawn. So the suspense lay in wondering not whether a chess-playing computer would ever beat the best human chess player, but to what degree programming elegance would play a role in the victory. Deep Blue won earlier than it might have, scoring a point for elegance.
* As I pointed out earlier, the idea of AI has shifted the psychological projection of adorable qualities from computer programs alone to a different target: computer-plus-crowd constructions. So, in 1999 a wikilike crowd of people, including chess champions, gathered to play Kasparov in an online game called “Kasparov versus the World.” In this case Kasparov won, though many believe that it was only because of back-stabbing between members of the crowd. We technologists are ceaselessly intrigued by rituals in which we attempt to pretend that people are obsolete.
* When people are told that a computer is intelligent, they become prone to changing themselves in order to make the computer appear to work better, instead of demanding that the computer be changed to become more useful.

* printing presses in themselves provide no guarantee of an enlightened outcome.

* People will accept ideas presented in technological form that would be abhorrent in any other form
* using computers to reduce individual expression is a primitive, retrograde activity, no matter how sophisticated your tools are.
* This desire for absolute order usually leads to tears in human affairs, so there is a historical reason to distrust it
* An underlying problem is that technical people overreact to religious extremists
* u could always create a list of links to your friends on your website, and you could always send e-mails to a circle of friends announcing whatever you cared to. All that the social networking services offer is a prod to use the web in a particular way, according to a particular philosophy.
* The idea of friendship in database-filtered social networks is certainly reduced from that.
* one must remember that the customers of social networks are not the members of those networks.The real customer is the advertiser of the future, but this creature has yet to appear in any significant way
* The only hope for social networking sites from a business point of view is for a magic formula to appear in which some method of violating privacy and dignity becomes acceptable.
* Every authentic example of collective intelligence that I am aware of also shows how that collective was guided or inspired by well-meaning individuals.
* The “wisdom of crowds” effect should be thought of as a tool. The value of a tool is its usefulness in accomplishing a task. The point should never be the glorification of the tool
* There’s an odd lack of curiosity about the limits of crowd wisdom. This is an indication of the faith-based motivations behind such schemes.
* People who can spontaneously invent a pseudonym in order to post a comment on a blog or on YouTube are often remarkably mean. Buyers and sellers on eBay are a little more civil, despite occasional disappointments, such as encounters with flakiness and fraud. Based on those data, you could conclude that it isn’t exactly anonymity, but transient anonymity, coupled with a lack of consequences, that brings out online idiocy.
* A summary of the ideology goes like this: All those nontechnical, ignorant, innocent people out there are going about their lives thinking that they are safe, when in actuality they are terribly vulnerable to those who are smarter than they are. Therefore, we smartest technical people ought to invent ways to attack the innocents, and publicize our results, so that everyone is alerted to the dangers of our superior powers. After all, a clever evil person might come along.

* Any other form of expression is to be remashed, anonymized, and decontextualized to the point of meaninglessness. Ads, however, are to be made ever more contextual, and the content of the ad is absolutely sacrosanct
* If money is flowing to advertising instead of musicians, journalists, and artists, then a society is more concerned with manipulation than truth or beauty.
* Instead of facing up to a tough press, the administration was made vaguely aware of mobs of noisily opposed bloggers nullifying one another

* The Cloudy Edge Between Self-Delusion and Corruption
* According to the new ideology, which is a blending of cyber-cloud faith and neo-Milton Friedman economics, the market will not only do what’s best, it will do better the less people understand it. I disagree. The financial crisis brought about by the U.S. mortgage meltdown of 2008 was a case of too many people believing in the cloud too much.
* Making money in the cloud doesn’t necessarily bring rain to the ground.
* However, it must be pointed out that in practice, even if you believe in the big n as a substitute for judgment, n is almost never big enough to mean anything on the internet. As vast as the internet has become, it usually isn’t vast enough to generate valid statistics. The overwhelming majority of entries garnering reviews on sites like Yelp or Amazon have far too few reviewers to reach any meaningful level of statistical utility. Even when n is large, there’s no guarantee it’s valid.

* Capitalism is like that. It gives us the buzz of freedom
* . In my view, people have often respected bits too much, resulting in a creeping degradation of their own qualities as human beings.
* flatness, as applied to human affairs, leads to blandness and meaninglessness
* There’s a rule of thumb you can count on in each succeeding version of the web 2.0 movement: the more radical an online social experiment is claimed to be, the more conservative, nostalgic, and familiar the result will actually be.
* The distinction between first-order expression and derivative expression is lost on true believers in the hive. First-order expression is when someone presents a whole, a work that integrates its own worldview and aesthetic. It is something genuinely new in the world.Second-order expression is made of fragmentary reactions to first-order expression
* I’m not anti-open source. I frequently argue for it in various specific projects. But the politically correct dogma that holds that open source is automatically the best path to creativity and innovation is not borne out by the facts
* digital image of sufficient resolution can capture any kind of perceivable image—or at least that’s how you’ll think of it if you believe in bits too much.
* What makes something fully real is that it is impossible to represent it to completion.
* A digital image, or any other kind of digital fragment, is a useful compromise. It captures a certain limited measurement of reality within a standardized system that removes any of the original source’s unique qualities
* Digital production usually has an overly regular beat because it comes out of a looper or a sequencer. And because it uses samples, you hear identical microstructure in sound again and again, making it seem as if the world is not fully alive while the music is playing.
* Context has always been part of expression, because expression becomes meaningless if the context becomes arbitrary. You could come up with an invented language in which the letters that compose the words to John Lennon’s “Imagine” instead spell out the instructions for cleaning a refrigerator. Meaning is only ever meaning in context.
* The alternative to wide-open development is not necessarily evil. My guess is that a poorly encapsulated communal gloop of organisms lost out to closely guarded species on the primordial Earth for the same reason that the Linux community didn’t come up with the iPhone: encapsulation serves a purpose.

* humans are the result of billions of years of implicit, evolutionary study in the school of hard knocks.
* Young people announce every detail of their lives on services like Twitter not to show off, but to avoid the closed door at bedtime, the empty room, the screaming vacuum of an isolated mind.
* At these companies one finds rooms full of MIT PhD engineers not seeking cancer cures or sources of safe drinking water for the underdeveloped world but schemes to send little digital pictures of teddy bears and dragons between adult members of social networks. At the end of the road of the pursuit of technological sophistication appears to lie a playhouse

The Ajax Dilemma
****************

*Woodruff, Paul*  (4294969040)

* Honor and anger are wired to the same fuse.
* An incentive is a management tool for influencing behavior; its opposite is a penalty.
* Incentives do not necessarily recognize anyone as an individual; that is why they carry no honor
* Trojan Horses, to stay alive, must be well-kept secrets.
* Incentives and penalties are management tools.
* Incentives and penalties do not belong to the language of leadership
* We are human. We all die like grass in summer, we fall like leaves in winter
* Your honor is a trap. Justice drowns in it.
* justice is what keeps society from flying apart into dangerous fragments.
* You may enjoy your honor only so long as you have a community that honors you
* Justice is at stake, the very existence of justice hangs in the balance. Think what this means. Justice is more important than food or water or shelter or sex or anything else that people want. Without justice, friendships break up like boats on sharp rocks. Without justice, quarreling would burst through our army like wildfire. Without justice, honor is meaningless. You may enjoy your honor only so long as you have a community that honors you. But without justice, the community is lost, and there will be no one left to give you honor. Without justice, you cannot be sure of having any good thing for more than a day. Your family, your livelihood, even your life is at risk, if justice goes away.
* The past cannot be recalled
* A consolation prize is an insult to an adult.
* Leadership is easiest to spot when it’s not there
* Ajax used to be lovable enough, but now he has changed. The lovable, loyal, hardworking soldier has transformed himself into a furious killing machine, driven by the anger that grew from shame and dishonor. He was always a man who cared about honor, who did the honorable thing again and again, and was honored for what he did. But now Odysseus’s victory in the contest has put him to shame. The more you care about honor, the worse it hurts to be put to shame. And shame leads to anger—anger at those who shamed you, anger at those who saw you being shamed, and anger at yourself for being shamed. Ajax’s love of honor was prodigious, and so, therefore, was his anger.
* And shame leads to anger
* It is devastating to be told that you are disposable, while other people are not.
* Principles are an obstacle to compassion.
* if you wish to nourish compassion in your heart, do not cling to principles.
* Justice is supposed to be the virtue that maintains peace, but justice has been a frequent cause for war
* Justice is supposed to be the virtue that maintains peace, but justice has been a frequent cause for war, probably because the word “justice” for many people stands for principles that must be defended at all costs. The poet William Stafford wrote of “the sickness of lusting after justice.”3 This is a sickness that does not infect Odysseus.
* It is a fine and uniquely Greek irony that the founding poem of Greek culture shows the Greeks less civilized than the barbarian Trojans.
* if both sides accept the procedure, then justice requires them to accept the result.
* The more fairness we put into the procedure, the greater the insult to the loser,
* Fairness is a trap
* You lose your grip on justice if you care about it too much
* A really good thing—an ideal—usually has a double that is not so good
* Doubles have this general feature: they are attractive because they are easy to define
* Really good things are ideals; they are hard to define and even harder to bring into our lives
* reflection and discussion, are essential because they can alert us to the possibility of error.
* wisdom is hard to define.
* Wisdom is the ability to make good decisions in demanding circumstances
* The best-known double for leadership is management, defined as the knowledge or skill of getting people to carry out your wishes
* Justice must pay attention to the factors that govern human behavior, whether they are rational or not.
* The main nonrational factors that drive human behavior fall in two groups:
* those to do with big emotions, and those to do with desires.
* The goal of justice is pragmatic. Justice is a virtue of individuals and communities that prevents civil war.3 Of course, a dictator or oligarchy can prevent civil war without any recourse to justice, as millions of oppressed people can attest. When a society fractures from within, we know that justice has failed somewhere. We may not know whose injustice is to blame. Perhaps the whole society failed, or perhaps a group of its members have gone off the rails, or perhaps the failure is due entirely to an absence of leadership.
* When a community does not fracture, we do not know whether it is held together by justice or by repression, or by some combination of the two. If we find what is missing in a failed society, then we have found something necessary for justice. But if we point out factors that are present in cohesive societies, we are no closer to a full theory of justice. In other words, we can know with some certainty how we could fail at justice, but we cannot know for sure—and therefore we must continue to discuss and debate—what would make our society more just. A philosopher would say that we can identify necessary conditions for justice without making progress on sufficient conditions.
* Nothing would be more unjust than to pretend that justice is not a problem
* Justice will always be a problem.
* Bringing these three points into line cannot be easy. All three call for explanation. The first—sustaining community—calls for a sort of harmony but not for general agreement or consonance.7 Justice is compatible with there being fissures opening between factions, so long as these are not so deep as to lead to civil war. And it is compatible with Ajax’s being a sore loser, so long as he does not turn to sabotage (killing the generals) or defection (killing himself).
* Do not demand, however, that the members be rational.
* Justice has to take the nonrational into account in order to be credible
* No one who has chaired an academic department would believe that higher education leads to rational behavior in a community.
* The question you ask changes their answer.
* The Ajax dilemma concerns a decision over a clash of values
* We cannot test hypotheses about justice through social experiments. Only in thought.
* Anger is to injustice as pain is to injury
* If you do not notice pain, you may perish through unnoticed injuries
* If you tend to be too angry, or not angry enough, your sense of justice is out of whack
* Justice is not good enough if it is merely mind-deep.
* Justice has to permeate the whole soul, into the depths where anger lives,
* into the dark recesses where desires are fermenting.
* justice is an arrangement of the human soul that prevents self-destructive internal conflict
* and at the same time prevents the sort of civil conflict that could destroy a community
* The most sophisticated philosopher can go berserk on finding that a colleague has been given a larger raise.
* 6.  Ruth Marcus pointed this out to me: the goal of justice could not be mere survival, as that would be too low a bar. It must be eudaimonia.
* Riches are often like the armor of Achilles, which cannot be worn by either Ajax or Odysseus
* A concern for being equal to others tends to alienate people from themselves
* We should look upon the younger generation with awe because how are we to know that those who come after us will not prove our equals
* we all respect each other, we cannot all honor each other.
* Where you give honor, you are giving respect, but not the other way around
* The opposite of respect is exclusion. The opposite of honor is insult (dishonor)
* we confuse honor with respect, and so we feel that because we have been denied an honor we have been denied respect.
* Like justice, this wisdom is an ideal. We will never find it perfectly in any classroom or any other leadership situation.
* Above all, wisdom is knowing who you are
* You are a human being: you will die someday, and before then you have time to make mistakes, some of them serious.
* The good decisions you make could lead to trouble,
* your good deeds could be counted against you.
* Human wisdom is not merely knowing facts
* By “dilemma” I mean a problem for which we cannot pull a solution out of facts or rules and regulations.
* Good judgment asks for advice, but advice won’t solve the problem
* Leadership is the form of power that is compatible with freedom.2 Tyranny destroys freedom, and all forms of authority compromise freedom to some extent. You might conclude that we would be most free if we were beyond the reach of every kind of power, but that would be a mistake. Without leadership, we would not be free to do the many of the things we most want to do, which require some degree of social organization. Leadership makes freedom possible—because leadership uses its influence to help us accomplish what we want, as opposed to what those in authority would like us to want.3
* all forms of authority compromise freedom to some extent.
* The necessity of choice is frightening, and many of us seek out ways to escape it. Those ways are inherently dishonest.
* Leaders Are Not Afraid of Losing Their Authority
* To rest upon a formula is a slumber that, prolonged, means death.
* general propositions do not decide concrete cases,
* managers, like judges, are not immune to the siren song of fixed and settled rules.
* Beware of geeks bearingformulas
* Rule-based incentives are no substitute for good judgment and goodwill.
* “a single cog in an ever-moving mechanism which prescribed to him an essentially fixed route of march.”
* In an environment of shared governance, where legitimacy and power are drawn from the same well, a showing of fairness is easily mistaken for a showing of force
* standardization is among the greatest enemies of justice in the distribution of rewards
* In its strongest forms, standardization causes pay to become entirely dissociated from individual performance
* leaving no room for the rewards that a healthy community bestows on individuals in recognition of meritorious service.
* Thus it is no surprise that, in a recent survey of top government human resources officers, more than two-thirds of participants favored eliminating or significantly reforming the General Schedule, citing its inflexibility and its failure to link pay to performance.37 Some participants did appreciate the General Schedule’s transparency and consistency, but transparency is not an unqualified good,38 and, as Paul Woodruff has shown us, consistency is a path to mere fairness, not justice. As one top government human resources executive explained, “The best thing [about the General Schedule] is that it’s predictable; the worst thing is that it’s predictable.”39 Neutrality in the civil service is a worthy goal, but when implemented by way of rule-driven standardization, it comes at too great a cost.

What Money Can't Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets
*************************************************

*Michael Sandel*  (4294968960)

* While it is certainly true that greed played a role in the financial crisis, something bigger is at stake. The most fateful change that unfolded during the past three decades was not an increase in greed. It was the expansion of markets, and of market values, into spheres of life where they don’t belong.
* in the United States and Britain, where the number of private guards is more than twice the number of public police officers
* Economists often assume that markets are inert, that they do not affect the goods they exchange. But this is untrue. Markets leave their mark. Sometimes, market values crowd out nonmarket values worth caring about
* These uses of markets to allocate health, education, public safety, national security, criminal justice, environmental protection, recreation, procreation, and other social goods were for the most part unheard of thirty years ago.
* markets don’t only allocate goods; they also express and promote certain attitudes toward the goods being exchanged
* when we decide that certain goods may be bought and sold, we decide, at least implicitly, that it is appropriate to treat them as commodities, as instruments of profit and use.
* some of the good things in life are corrupted or degraded if turned into commodities.
* This need for discretion suggests that paid line cutting—even in an amusement park—tugs against a nagging sense that fairness means waiting your turn.
* the system rewards unsavory middlemen rather than those who provide the care.
* the ethic of the queue—“first come, first-served”—is being displaced by the ethic of the market—“you get what you pay for.”
* And this shift reflects something bigger—the growing reach of money and markets into spheres of life once governed by nonmarket norms.
* If the free-market argument is correct, ticket scalpers and line-standing companies should not be vilified for violating the integrity of the queue; they should be praised for improving social utility by making underpriced goods available to those most willing to pay for them.
* the willingness to pay for a good does not show who values it most highly.
* market prices reflect the ability as well as the willingness to pay.
* Since market prices reflect the ability as well as the willingness to pay, they are imperfect indicators of who most values a particular good.
* To corrupt a good or a social practice is to degrade it, to treat it according to a lower mode of valuation than is appropriate to it.
* Under what conditions do market relations reflect freedom of choice, and under what conditions do they exert a kind of coercion?
* we corrupt a good, an activity, or a social practice whenever we treat it according to a lower norm than is appropriate to it.
* What economics offers, they argue, is not merely a set of insights about the production and consumption of material goods but also a science of human behavior. At the heart of this science is a simple but sweeping idea: In all domains of life, human behavior can be explained by assuming that people decide what to do by weighing the costs and benefits of the options before them, and choosing the one they believe will give them the greatest welfare, or utility.
* They induce us to do the right thing for the wrong reason.
* eventually, we should rise above manipulation. Otherwise, the bribe may become habit forming.
* the economist’s question (“Do cash incentives work?”) and the moralist’s question (“Are they objectionable?”) are more closely connected than first appears
* wo incentives work better than one. But it could also turn out that the monetary incentive undermines the intrinsic one, leading to less reading rather than more. Or to more reading in the short run but for the wrong reason.
* the economist’s failure to distinguish between the willingness and the ability to pay
* markets are not mere mechanisms. They embody certain norms. They presuppose—and promote—certain ways of valuing the goods being exchanged.
* Fines register moral disapproval, whereas fees are simply prices that imply no moral judgment.
* We should try to strengthen, not weaken, the moral stigma attached to despoiling the environment.
* Betrayal isn’t objectionable only, or mainly, because it increases the sum of unhappiness in the world; it’s a wrong to a particular person that can’t be set right by a virtuous act elsewhere.
* it is important to remember that it is bribery we are engaged in, a morally compromised practice that substitutes a lower norm (reading to make money) for a higher one (reading for the love of it).
* We can’t decide whether to buy and sell the right to shoot rhinos without resolving the moral question about the proper way of valuing them
* markets don’t pass judgment on the desires they satisfy
* The language of incentives is a recent development in economic thought.
* It is easy to miss the novelty of this definition. The language of incentives is a recent development in economic thought. The word “incentive” does not appear in the writings of Adam Smith or other classical economists.62 In fact, it didn’t enter economic discourse until the twentieth century and didn’t become prominent until the 1980s and 1990s. The Oxford English Dictionary finds its first use in the context of economics in 1943, in Reader’s Digest: “Mr. Charles E. Wilson … is urging war industries to adopt ‘incentive pay’—that is, to pay workers more if they produce more.” The use of the word “incentives” rose sharply in the second half of the twentieth century, as markets and market thinking deepened their hold. According to a Google book search, the incidence of the term increased by over 400 percent from the 1940s to the 1990s.63

* Apologies and wedding toasts are goods that can, in a sense, be bought. But buying and selling them changes their character and diminishes their value.
* As Aristotle taught, friendship at its best has a formative, educative purpose. To monetize all forms of giving among friends can corrupt friendship by suffusing it with utilitarian norms.
* To insist that the purpose of all gifts is to maximize utility is to assume, without argument, that the utility-maximizing conception of friendship is morally the most appropriate one
* So the economic case against gift giving is not morally neutral. It presupposes a certain conception of friendship, one that many consider impoverished. And yet, whatever its moral deficiency, the economic approach to gift giving is gradually taking hold. This brings us to the second revealing feature of the gift example. Contestable though its moral assumptions may be, the economic way of thinking about gifts is coming to be true. Over the past two de cades, the monetary aspect of gift giving has come closer to the surface.

* Hirsch argues that mainstream economics has overlooked what he calls the “commercialization effect.” By this he means “the effect on the characteristics of a product or activity of supplying it exclusively or predominantly on commercial terms rather than on some other basis—such as informal exchange, mutual obligation, altruism or love, or feelings of service or obligation.” The “common assumption, almost always hidden, is that the commercialization process does not affect the product.” Hirsch observes that this mistaken assumption loomed large in the rising “economic imperialism” of the time, including attempts, by Becker and others, to extend economic analysis into neighboring realms of social and political life.34

* Life insurance has always been two things in one: a pooling of risk for mutual security, and a grim wager, a hedge against death. These two aspects coexist in uneasy combination. In the absence of moral norms and legal restraints, the wagering aspect threatens to swamp the social purpose that justifies life insurance in the first place
* When the social purpose is lost or obscured, the fragile lines separating insurance, investment, and gambling come undone.
* The death pool, frivolous and marginal though it seems, is actually the dark twin of life insurance—the wager without the redeeming social good.
* Insurance is a way of mitigating risk, while gambling is a way of courting it.
* Insurance is about prudence; gambling is about speculation. But the line between these activities has always been unstable.27

* making markets more efficient is no virtue in itself. The real question is whether introducing this or that market mechanism will improve or impair the good of the game. It’s a question worth asking not only of baseball but also of the societies in which we live.
* Writing in 1914, Walter Lippmann lamented “the deceptive clamor that disfigures the scenery, covers fences, plasters the city, and blinks and winks at you through the night.” Ads seemed to be everywhere. The eastern sky was “ablaze with chewing gum, the northern with tooth-brushes and underwear, the western with whiskey, the southern with petticoats, the whole heavens brilliant with monstrously flirtatious women.”
* In 1983, U.S. companies spent $100 million advertising to children. In 2005, they spent $16.8 billion.
* Advertising encourages people to want things and to satisfy their desires. Education encourages people to reflect critically on their desires, to restrain or to elevate them
* Markets leave their mark.
* Beyond the damage it does to particular goods, commercialism erodes commonality. The more things money can buy, the fewer the occasions when people from different walks of life encounter one another
* And so, in the end, the question of markets is really a question about how we want to live together. Do we want a society where everything is up for sale? Or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor and money cannot buy?

Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity

*David Allen*  (4294969268)

* But for most people, most of the time, approaches that are incremental and forgiving of error are more likely to pay off in the long run.

* Anxiety is caused by a lack of control, organization, preparation, and action.
* An ambient angst pervades our society—there’s a sense that somehow there’s probably something we should be doing that we’re not, which creates a tension for which there is no resolution and from which there is no rest.
* Healthy skepticism is often the best way to glean the value of what’s being presented—challenge it; prove it wrong, if you can. That creates engagement, which is the key to understanding.
* people have enhanced quality of life, but at the same time they are adding to their stress levels by taking on more than they have resources to handle.
* Almost every project could be done better, and an infinite quantity of information is now available that could make that happen.
* Chaos isn’t the problem; how long it takes to find coherence is the real game.

* most stress they experience comes from inappropriately managed commitments they make or accept.
* Anything that does not belong where it is, the way it is, is an “open loop,” which will be pulling on your attention if it’s not appropriately managed.
* But what created that? Not “getting organized” or “setting priorities.” The answer is, thinking. Not a lot; just enough to solidify your commitment about a discrete pressure or opportunity and the resources required dealing with it. People think a lot, but most of that thinking is of a problem, project, or situation—not about it. If you actually did this suggested exercise, you were required to structure your thinking toward an outcome and an action, and that does not usually happen without a consciously focused effort. Reacting is automatic, but thinking is not.
* Reacting is automatic, but thinking is not.
* In knowledge work . . . the task is not given; it has to be determined
* We’re never really taught that we have to think about our work before we can do it; much of our daily activity is already defined for us by the undone and unmoved things staring at us when we come to work, or by the family to be fed, the laundry to be done, or the children to be dressed at home
* Thought is useful when it motivates action and a hindrance when it substitutes for action.
* Before you can achieve any of that, though, you’ll need to get in the habit of keeping nothing on your mind. A
* you don’t manage priorities—you have them.
* Instead, the key to managing all of your stuff is managing your actions
* It’s extremely difficult to manage actions you haven’t identified or decided on
* Things rarely get stuck because of lack of time. They get stuck because what “doing” would look like, and where it happens, hasn’t been decided.
* Getting things done requires two basic components: defining (1) what “done” means (outcome) and (2) what “doing” looks like (action). And thes
* The trouble is, however, that most people are so embroiled in commitments on a day-to-day level that their ability to focus successfully on the larger horizon is seriously impaired. Consequently, a bottom-up approach is usually more effective.
* Horizontal control maintains coherence across all the activities in which you are involved.
* Vertical control, in contrast, manages thinking, development, and coordination of individual topics and projects
* There is usually an inverse relationship between how much something is on your mind and how much it’s getting done.
* There is no reason to ever have the same thought twice, unless you like having that thought.
* Any “would, could, or should” commitment held only in the psyche creates irrational and unresolvable pressure, 24-7.
* It is hard to fight an enemy who has outposts in your head.
* Don’t let life get in your way.
* Small leaks, with added pressure, become big ones.
* Many people don’t look ahead at their own calendars consistently enough to stay current about upcoming events and deadlines, and they consequently become victims of last-minute craziness.
* A task left undone remains undone in two places—at the actual location of the task, and inside your head. Incomplete tasks in your head consume the energy of your attention as they gnaw at your conscience
* Emptying the contents does not mean that you have to finish what’s there; it just means that you have to decide more specifically what it is and what should be done with it, and if it’s still unfinished, organize it into your system.
* Not emptying your in-tray is like having garbage cans and mailboxes that no one ever dumps or deals with—you just have to keep buying new ones to hold an eternally accumulating volume.
* Blockage in the flow of anything undermines the ability to be present, fresh, and creative in that arena.
* It is better to be wrong than to be vague.			—Freeman Dyson
* You can’t organize what’s incoming—you can only capture it and process it.
* Blessed are the flexible, for they shall not be bent out of shape.
* the calendar should be sacred territory. If you write something there, it must get done that day or not at all. The only rewriting should be for changed appointments.
* No-action systems fall into three categories: trash, incubation, and reference.
* The most important thing to remember here is that reference should be exactly that—information that can be easily referred to when required. Reference systems generally take two forms: (1) topic- and area-specific storage, and (2) general-reference files. The first types usually define themselves in terms of how they are stored—for example, a file drawer dedicated to contracts, by date; a drawer containing only confidential employee-compensation information; a series of cabinets for closed legal cases that might need to be consulted for future trials; or a customer relations management (CRM) database for client and prospect histories.
* If your reference material doesn’t have nice clean edges to it, the line between actionable and nonactionable items will blur, visually and psychologically, and your mind will go numb to the whole business
* Everything that might require action must be reviewed on a frequent enough basis to keep your mind from taking back the job of remembering and reminding
* All of your Projects, active project plans, and Next Actions, Agendas, Waiting For, and even Someday/Maybe lists should be reviewed once a week
* You have to use your mind to get things off your mind.
* Every decision to act is an intuitive one. The challenge is to migrate from hoping it’s the right choice to trusting it’s the right choice.
* There is always more to do than you can do, and you can do only one thing at a time. The key is to feel as good about what you’re not doing as about what you are doing at that moment.
* Priorities should drive your choices, but most models for determining them are not reliable tools for much of our real work activity
* THE KEY INGREDIENTS of relaxed control are (1) clearly defined outcomes (projects) and the next actions required to move them toward closure, and (2) reminders placed in a trusted system that is reviewed regularly
* The good news is, there is a productive way to think about projects, situations, and topics that creates maximum value with minimal expenditure of time and effort. It happens to be the way we naturally plan when we consciously try to get a project under control or simply execute for a desired outcome. In my experience, when people do more planning, informally and naturally, they relieve a great deal of stress and obtain better results.
* The key to intelligent thought is more intelligent thinking
* It’s how you create things—dinner, a relaxing evening, a new product, or a new company. You have an urge to make something happen; you image the outcome; you generate ideas that might be relevant; you sort those into a structure; and you define a physical activity that would begin to make it a reality. And you do all of that naturally, without giving it much thought.
* If you’re waiting to have a good idea before you have any ideas, you won’t have many.
* What’s the assumption here? Before any evaluation of what’s a good idea can be trusted, the purpose must be clear, the vision must be well defined, and all the relevant data must have been collected (brainstormed) and analyzed (organized). “What’s a good idea?” is a good question, but only when you’re about 80 percent of the way through your thinking! Starting there would probably blow anyone’s creative mental fuses.
* When you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.
* Don’t just do something. Stand there.
* Fanaticism consists of redoubling your efforts when you have forgotten your aim.					—George Santayana
* To know and to be clear about the purpose of any activity are prime directives for appropriate focus, creative development, and cooperation.
* Here are just some of the benefits of asking why:							It defines success.				It creates decision-making criteria.				It aligns resources.				It motivates.				It clarifies focus.				It expands
* People love to win. If you’re not totally clear about the purpose of what you’re doing, you have no game to win.
* Often the only way to make a hard decision is to come back to the purpose of what you’re doing
* Simple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex and intelligent behavior. Complex rules and regulations give rise to simple and stupid behavior.
* Whereas purpose provides the juice and the direction, principles define the parameters of action and the criteria for excellence of conduct.
* In order to most productively access the conscious and unconscious resources available to you, you must have a clear picture in your mind of what success would look, sound, and feel like. Purpose and principles furnish the impetus and the monitoring
* You often need to make it up in your mind before you can make it happen in your life.
* The best way to get a good idea is to get lots of ideas.
* Nothing is more dangerous than an idea when it is the only one you have.
* The habit of clarifying the next action on projects, no matter what the situation, is fundamental to you staying in relaxed control.
* If the next action is not yours, you must nevertheless clarify whose it is
* next-action conversation forces organizational clarity.
* How much of this planning model do you really need to flesh out, and to what degree of detail? The simple answer is, as much as you need to get the project off your mind.
* If the project is still on your mind, there’s more thinking required.
* You need no new skills to increase your productivity and reduce your stress—just an enhanced set of systematic behaviors with which to apply them.
* Plans get you into things but you’ve got to work your way out.
* It is easier to act yourself into a better way of feeling than to feel yourself into a better way of action.
* Don’t be afraid to take a big step if one is indicated. You can’t cross a chasm in two small jumps.
* One of the best tricks for enhancing your productivity is having organizing tools you love to use.
* Keep in mind, though, that the tool you use will not give you stress-free productivity. That is something you create by implementing the GTD method. The structure you incorporate will be extremely important in how you express and implement the process, but it is not a substitute for it. A great hammer doesn’t make a great carpenter; but a great carpenter will always want to have a great hammer.

Philosophy: The Basics
**********************

*Nigel Warburton*  (4294969741)

* Arguments from analogy rely on there being a strong similarity between the two things being compared.
* If the similarity is weak, then the conclusions that can be drawn on the basis of the comparison are correspondingly weak.
* the Design Argument alone cannot prove that the Theists' God rather than some other type of God or gods exists.
* The mistake that defenders of the Anthropic Principle make is to assume that when something happens which is unlikely that there must be a more plausible explanation of it than that it arose naturally
* The First Cause Argument states that absolutely everything has been caused by something else prior to it: nothing has just sprung into existence without a cause
* David Hume, in Section X of his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, argued that a rational person should never believe a report that a miracle had actually taken place unless it would be a greater miracle that the person reporting the miracle was mistaken. This, he argued, is highly unlikely ever to be so. We should, as a policy, always believe whatever would be the lesser miracle. In this statement Hume is deliberately playing on the meaning of ‘miracle'. As we have already seen, a miracle in the strict sense is a transgression of a law of nature presumed to have been caused by God. However, when Hume declares that we should believe whatever is the lesser miracle, he is using the word ‘miracle' in the everyday sense which can include something which is merely out of the ordinary.

* Belief in God, they might say, is not a matter for abstract intellectual speculation, but rather for personal commitment.
* It is a matter of faith, not of the clever employment of reason.
* Is morality simply a matter of prejudice or can we give good reasons for our moral beliefs?
* Does God command or love what he or she does because it is morally good? Or does God's commanding or loving it make it morally good?
* the consequences of actions are often outside our control, these consequences cannot be crucial to morality
* Kant thought morality was a system of categorical imperatives: commands to act in certain ways.
* Kant believed that as rational human beings we have certain duties. These duties are categorical: in other words they are absolute and unconditional—duties such as ‘You ought always to tell the truth' or ‘You ought never to kill anyone.' They apply whatever consequences might follow from obeying them. Kant thought morality was a system of categorical imperatives: commands to act in certain ways. This is one of the most distinctive aspects of his ethics. He contrasted categorical duties with hypothetical ones. A hypothetical duty is one such as ‘If you want to be respected, then you ought to tell the truth' or ‘If you want to avoid going to prison, then you ought not to murder anyone.' Hypothetical duties tell you what you ought or ought not to do if you want to achieve or avoid a certain goal. He thought there was only one basic Categorical Imperative: ‘Act only on maxims which you can at the same time will to be universal laws.' ‘Will' here means ‘rationally want'. In other words, the message of the Categorical Imperative is only act on a maxim you would rationally want to apply to everybody. This principle is known as the principle of universalizability.
* Hypothetical duties tell you what you ought or ought not to do if you want to achieve or avoid a certain goal.
* Kant thought that for an action to be moral, the underlying maxim had to be a universalizable one
* It had to be a maxim which would hold for anyone else in similar circumstances.
* Another of Kant’s versions of the Categorical Imperative was ‘Treat other people as ends in themselves, never as means to an end.'
* Utilitarianism is based on the assumption that the ultimate aim of all human activity is (in some sense) happiness.
* Utilitarianism has to deal in probable consequences because it is usually extremely difficult, if not impossible, to predict the precise results of any particular action: for example, insulting people usually makes them feel unhappy, but the person you are insulting may turn out to be a masochist who takes great pleasure from being insulted.
* It is an intellectual's justification for his own particular preferences and the interests and values of his social class.
* happiness is not just a matter of mental states, but includes a notion of how those states are produced.
* The basic principle of negative utilitarianism is that the best action in any circumstances is not the one which produces the greatest balance of happiness over unhappiness for the greatest number of people, but the one which produces the least overall amount of unhappiness.
* Unlike Kant, Aristotle thought that experiencing appropriate emotions was central to the art of leading a good life.
* The danger is that virtue theorists simply redefine their prejudices and preferred ways of life as virtues, and the activities they dislike as vices
* Thus virtue theory can be used as an intellectual smokescreen behind which prejudices are smuggled in.
* Moral philosophers are also interested in second-order questions: these are questions not about what we ought to do but about the status of ethical theories.
* A typical meta-ethical theory asks ‘What is the meaning of “right” in the moral context?'
* Many philosophers believe that all naturalistic ethical theories are based on a mistake: the failure to recognise that facts and values are fundamentally different sorts of things
* moral relativism, makes morality simply a description of the values held by a particular society at a particular time.
* Moral judgements can only be judged true or false relative to a particular society.
* There are no absolute moral judgements: they are all relative.
* we should never interfere with the customs of other societies on the grounds that there is no neutral standpoint from which to judge.
* This view has been especially popular with anthropologists, perhaps partly because they have often seen at first hand the destruction wreaked on other societies by a crude importation of Western values.
* Another important meta-ethical theory is known as emotivism or noncognitivism. Emotivists, such as A.J.Ayer (1910-1988) in Chapter 6 of his Language, Truth and Logic, claim that all ethical statements are literally meaningless. They do not express any facts at all; what they express is the speaker's emotion. Moral judgements have no literal meaning at all: they are just expressions of emotion, like grunts, sighs, or laughter.
* They do not express any facts at all; what they express is the speaker's emotion.
* Moral judgements have no literal meaning at all: they are just expressions of emotion, like grunts, sighs, or laughter.
* emotivism has sometimes been called the Boo/Hooray theory
* Whilst philosophy does not give easy answers to these or any moral questions, it does provide a vocabulary and a framework within which such questions can be intelligently discussed.
* Complete uniformity has little appeal.
* Egalitarians can't be proposing a world populated by clones
* the idea that anyone who wants to become a dentist or a surgeon should be allowed to do so, no matter how bad their eye/hand co-ordination, is clearly absurd.
* Reverse discrimination means actively recruiting people from previously underprivileged groups
* reverse discriminators deliberately treat job applicants unequally in that they are biased towards people from groups against which discrimination has usually been directed.
* One definition of freedom is the absence of coercion
* If no one is actively preventing you from doing something, then in that respect you are free.
* Historically, science replaced ‘truth by authority'.
* seeing something isn't just having an image on your retina.
* There is more to seeing than meets the eyeball.'
* the simple view assumes that our knowledge and expectations do not affect our observations,
* What we see usually depends on what is called our ‘mental set': our knowledge and expectations, and, for that matter, our cultural upbringing.
* What you see usually depends on what you know
* the words you choose to describe what you see always presuppose a theory of the nature of the thing you see.
* A different sort of objection to the simple view of scientific method arises because it relies on induction rather than deduction
* An inductive argument involves a generalization based on a certain number of specific observations.
* Deductive arguments are truth-preserving. This means that if their premises are true, then their conclusions must be true. You would contradict yourself if you asserted the premises but denied the conclusion. So if ‘All birds are animals' and ‘Swans are birds' are both true, then it must be true that all swans are animals. In contrast, the conclusions of inductive arguments with true premises may or may not be true. Even though every observation of animals with fur that I made was accurate, and the animals were all viviparous, and even though I made many thousands of observations, my inductive conclusion that all animals with fur are viviparous could still turn out to be false. In fact the existence of the duck-billed platypus, a peculiar fur-covered animal which lays eggs, means that it is a false generalization.
* In contrast, the conclusions of inductive arguments with true premises may or may not be true.
* It is induction which leads us to expect that the future will resemble the past.
* No other form of argument will help us predict the future better than the principle of induction.
* Science works by attempting to falsify theories rather than by proving them to be true
* the generalization is far easier to disprove than to prove.
* The more falsifiable a statement is, the more useful it is to science
* Psychology is the scientific study of human behaviour and thought: it is based on observation of people, often under experimental conditions
* philosophy of mind is not an experimental subject: it does not involve making actual scientific observations.
* A dualist typically believes that body and mind are distinct substances which interact with each other but remain separate
* Consciousness may be hard to define but it certainly includes sensations, feelings, pain, joy, desire, and so on.
* Genuine art has no purpose: it is an end in itself.
* Entertainment art is a craft, and therefore inferior to art proper.
* Similarly, purely religious art, so-called, is considered to be craft because it was made for a specific purpose.
* The idealist theory distinguishes art from craft.
* Works of art serve no particular purpose.
* In contrast, craft objects are created for a particular purpose, and the craftsperson begins with a plan rather than designing the object in the process of making it.
* The institutional theory, then, says that some individuals and groups in our society have an ability to change any artifact into a work of art by a simple action of ‘christening',
* which may take the form of calling something ‘art', but more often amounts to publishing, exhibiting, or performing the work.
* Artists themselves can be members of this art world.
* All members of this elite have the equivalent of King Midas' ability to turn everything he touched to gold.
* the image of members of the art world having the Midas touch is inappropriate.
* Gold is valuable; but, according to the institutional theory, there need be nothing of any value whatsoever in a work of art.
* institutional theory at least reminds us that what makes something a work of art is a cultural matter, dependent on social institutions at particular times rather than on some timeless canon.
* Irony is saying or depicting one thing, but meaning its opposite
* Price, snob value, and value as relic, have little to do with artistic merit
* The first is to do with rarity, the fluctuations of collectors' tastes, and the manipulations of the art dealers;
* the second is a matter of social rivalry; the third psychological, to do with the way we treat objects

* Simplicity matters because it affects goodness, but it turns out that the relationship between simplicity and goodness does not follow a straight line
* Ultimately, it does not matter how simple or complex something is. The only question is whether the thing is any good
* Which turn should you take? That depends on where you’re coming from and where you want to go
* As you read, keep in mind that the map is not the territory, and studying a map is no substitute for an actual expedition
* In virtually any context—business planning, software development, pizza making—the immature simplicity associated with first drafts, early prototypes, and initial versions tends to be unsatisfyingly e

* where we fall in love with complexity for its own sake rather than using complexity as a means to an end.
* The underlying dynamic is rooted in the fact that while complexity has a value, it also has a cost.
* The way of thinking which is the most inappropriate of all is the one which does not see, or worse, simply tolerates, unnecessary difficulty
* From there, it is only a small step to the degeneration of cults of collusion which not only condone, but actually cultivate complicatedness.
* Membership in these ridiculous cults is easy to come by, and sometimes even the wisest of us join the movement without deliberately deciding to sign up
* Hic sunt dracones.
* Somewhere along the way I managed to confuse complexity with value and ended up making things worse instead of better.
* Complexity may be essential, but complicatedness is not.
* It starts when we overvalue complexity, equating it with sophistication and implicitly assuming that if a little bit of complexity is good, then a lot is even better.
* Does complexity drive us crazy? Or does causality flow the other way? Perhaps insanity drives us toward complexity.
* I suspect our mental state is both a cause and an effect. The relationship between (in)sanity and (un)clarity works in both directions
* It perhaps bears repeating that a certain amount of complexity is valuable and necessary, but at some point complexity devolves into unreasonable complication, which makes things worse.
* too much information actually leads to worse decisions.
* We could depict the relationship Morville describes between information quantity and decision quality as a bell curve
* But at a certain point, learning more actually reduces decision quality
* Whether the topic is information or hardware, excessive complexity is often rooted in a lack of priorities

When Anger Hurts: Quieting the Storm Within
*******************************************

*McKay, Matthew*  (4294969080)

* What seemed so worthy of blame passes. What remains are the scars, the hurt, and the alienation.
* The truth is that anger begets anger. The more you shout, the more you invite shouting. The more you rage, the more you invite rage.
* The area of the brain that neurologists believe governs violent behavior is the limbic system
* The principal factor in successful evolution is cooperation rather than conflict
* biology does not condemn humanity to war, and that humanity can be freed from the bondage of biological pessimism
* Violence is neither in our evolutionary legacy nor in our genes.”
* Frustration can occur only when you have an expectation that is not fulfilled
* people who are most prone to vent their rages get angrier, not less angry.
* He found that couples who yell at each other feel more angry afterward, not less.
* Yelling or even talking out an emotion doesn’t reduce it. What actually happens is that you are rehearsing for more of the same. E
* Experimental studies consistently point out that the popular remedy for anger, ventilation, is really worse than useless. In fact, the reverse seems to be true: expressing anger tends to make you even angrier and solidifies an angry attitude.
* Anger is basically a matter of choice. It is determined by your thoughts and beliefs far more than your biochemistry or genetic heritage
* Venting anger rarely leads to any real relief or any lasting catharsis. It leads instead to more anger, tension, and arousal.
* fear and distress cause an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, constriction of blood vessels in the skin, and the shunting (diverting) of blood to the skeletal muscles.
* situations that are challenging and exciting result in the constriction of blood vessels in the skeletal muscles, and less change in heart and respiration rates.
* It seems that it doesn’t matter whether anger is expressed or suppressed. It’s just plain bad for you. Chro
* each angry episode you have cuts into the fabric of goodwill, care, and appreciation that’s vital to your relationships
* Angry people are experienced as dangerous, and they are handled like a loaded gun—with caution or downright avoidance.
* a primary result of aggressive behavior seems to be to stimulate both parties to continued aggression.”
* Anger-fueled hostility and aggression cuts and scars the tissue of relationships. Scar tissue isn’t healthy tissue. It’s thick and hard and inelastic. It serves to cover and protect, but it blocks out feeling
* As frequency of anger increases, there is a corresponding decrease in tolerance and flexibility
* ” All too common are the type A’s who have “simply burned themselves out in pointless struggle, impatience, and anger”
* Stress is the fuel of anger, because it creates high levels of physiological arousal that must be discharged
* The sole function of anger is to stop stress
* Anger is usually effective only in the short term as a stress-reduction strategy. In the long run, it harms your health and isolates you
* stress is not a sufficient cause for anger. You need the psychological flint of anger-triggering thoughts to convert stress into hostile affect.
* Stress (painful arousal) plus trigger thoughts equal anger. You cannot have anger without both components being present
* Trigger thoughts without arousal produce a judgment without emotion
* Arousal without trigger thoughts leaves you in a chronic state of pain until you choose an alternative stress-reduction strategy.
* If you use triggering statements that are false or distorted versions of reality, the emotional storm that erupts is a response not to a real issue, but to an imagined violation.
* Ventilationists claim that anger should be expressed because feelings have inherent legitimacy. As you’ve seen, a moment of anger can be fueled by many different, simultaneous experiences of stress. Although the pain is important, and perhaps even the expression of pain is important, the anger is usually destructive. It is not the anger that needs to come out, but the pain (stress) that underlies the anger. It is not the anger that is legitimate and right, but the human suffering that must be acknowledged and explored.
* It is not anger that builds, but stress.
* don’t ask yourself, “Did I get angry at the right person?” Ask yourself, “Did I express the pain in a way that may lead to a solution?”
* The impulse to assign blame lies at the root of chronic anger.
* If you feel that others should be willing to endure pain so that you won’t have to, or give up what is emotionally or physically nourishing so that you can be nourished, then you are expecting a degree of altruism that is rarely encountered
* Every relationship must come to terms with this basic reality: the pursuit of one person’s needs will frequently mean discomfort and frustration for the other.
* My old way of asking for support is too vague. It always ends up sounding like a complaint
* 4. Set limits. This is the art of saying no. Anger so often comes from feeling pressure to do specific things for others. Your trigger thoughts may include the notion that people have no right to ask certain things of you, or that they want too much. The problem is not the requests that people make of you—they’re entitled to ask for anything they want—the problem is your unwillingness to set limits. It’s your responsibility to say no to the things you prefer not to do. If you don’t give yourself permission to say no, you’ll often wind up using anger as protection from the wants and needs of others.
* imply making requests is often not enough. You may have to offer something in exchange or make compromises so that each party in the negotiation feels satisfied
* Letting go is usually the choice reserved for those times when other pathways to responsibility have not worked. Yet it is perhaps the most important of your options. It is your ultimate protection, your last response to a closing helplessness where nothing seems to change and you are in pain.
* The appropriate question is not “Who’s responsible for my pain?” but “What can I do about it?”
* All relationships come down to two basic choices: adapt or let go.
* My choice is to adapt or let go.
* Try saying, “You always make such a lovely salad.” Even while you are thinking, “The rest of the meal is inedible, unrecognizable, and possibly toxic.“
* How did it feel when you were able to control your anger? Did you feel more powerful? Did you feel more empathetic with others? Were you aware of feeling more vulnerable without your angry shield? How did it feel when you were not able to control your anger? Did you feel defeated? Discouraged? Challenged? Embarrassed?
* Pain does not make you angry. Thoughts make you angry; beliefs and assumptions make you angry.
* So the first problem with shoulds is that the people with whom you feel angry rarely agree with you. Their perception of the situation leaves them blameless and justified. Their rules and beliefs always seem to exempt them from the judgments you think they deserve. And the more you try to convince them of their wrongness and their failure, the more indignant and defensive they become.
* The second problem with shoulds is that people never do what they should do. They only do what is reinforcing and rewarding for them to do. Shoulds are your values and needs imposed on someone with different values and needs. The most complex human behavior can be looked at in terms of a very simple formula: strength of need minus strength of inhibition. If the strength of the inhibition is equal to or greater than the need, the person does not act. If the need surpasses the strength of the inhibition, some behavior will be activated. Consider the drivers who keep cutting in front of John. Their need to get ahead and save time is greater than the sum of all inhibiting factors—fear of disapproval or reprisal, fear of a traffic ticket, guilt for not waiting their turn, and so on. The same is true for Samantha’s husband. His need to watch television, sleep, read, or do whatever else he does instead of helping Samantha, must be presumed greater than his inhibitions—fear of Samantha’s disapproval, his self-rebuke for violating his own values of helpfulness and caring behavior, and so on.
* The entitlement fallacy is based on this simple belief: because I want something very much, I ought to have it
* My desire doesn’t obligate you to meet it.”
* And as the debate rages, each person gets locked into his or her fortress of conviction.
* Joan and Anthony no doubt heard their parents appeal to the concept of fairness when they were children. “Be fair to your brother, let him play with the toys…That’s not fair, let her have some of the ice cream too…I played with you now be fair and let Daddy read for a while.” Fairness is sometimes a useful concept for controlling the behavior of children (after all, there is an adult present to be the final judge of all such matters). But as an adult, the concept is just too dangerous to use. The word “fair” turns out to be nothing more than a disguise for personal preferences and wants. What you want or do is fair; what the other person wants or does is unfair.
* The Fallacy of ChangeThe fallacy of change is based on the assumption that you really can have control over the behavior of others. Although people sometimes do change if you ask them, the fallacy of change reflects the belief that you can make people behave differently if you just apply sufficient pressure
* The problem for both Richard and Leanne is that they are ignorant of one basic fact of human behavior: people change only when they are (1) reinforced to change and (2) capable of the change. In other words, people change when they want to, not when you want them to. Richard and Leanne find that their spouses are not changing, and the reason is that people do what is rewarding for them to do. Richard’s wife finds it more rewarding to talk about her friends’ psychology than the relationship between the United Arab League and the Islamists. Until Richard can make such discussions rewarding and fun for her, she will resist participating. Leanne has the same problem. Her husband is highly reinforced to keep doing the things he does. He won’t change until she can make it more rewarding for him to spend time with her. Her current strategy of getting angry is having the opposite effect. He finds it more and more difficult to spend time with her and hence takes refuge in his hobbies and dream journal.
* Expecting people to change leads to frustration and disillusion.
* Expecting people to change leads to frustration and disillusion. If you can’t find a way to make them want to change, you have undertaken a quixotic mission. You are tilting at windmills.
* Conditional assumptions are based on a syllogism like this:“If you loved me, you’d pick me up at the subway station after work (or
* No matter how much someone loves you, that person is still responsible for taking care of his or her own basic needs
* The Letting It Out FallacyThis fallacy rests on the belief that people who hurt you or cause you pain should be punished.
* When the object of your anger is to inflict the same degree of hurt that you are feeling on someone else, people begin to erect psychological barriers to protect themselves from you.
* The tendency to make inferences about how people feel and think is called mind reading. It is also called “assumed intent.”
* The word “assume” means that you think you know, but you never asked
* Global labels are always false because they focus on a single characteristic or behavior, but imply that it’s the whole picture.
* Now you’re ready to look at a problem-solving program that really works. In fact, it’s literally IDEAL, which means: Identify the problem; Develop alternatives; Explore the consequences; have an Action plan; and Look at the results. This IDEAL problem-solving program is adapted from Successful Problem Solving (McKay and Fanning 2002).
* By the time the dust settles, the room will have a radiation half-life of fifty years.
* Personality theorist Harry Stack Sullivan called this process parataxic distortion: the tendency to superimpose the experiences and meanings of an old relationship over a current one. It’s as if you were no longer really seeing and reacting to the person in front of you. You are instead responding to your father or sister or your first boyfriend.
* All-or-none, either-or, and black-or-white responses should also be suspected, since reality is rarely that clear-cut
* Everyone has the right to say no and to set limits.
* Understand that disappointing someone doesn’t always mean you don’t love, respect, or care for that person
* All addictions feel good at the moment, all addictions serve to block pain, and all addictions offer a short-term feeling of control and well-being.
* Anger not only prevents you from correcting fear-inducing distortions, it stops you from effectively coping with real threats.
* anger works in the short term to keep feelings of helplessness at bay. The long-term consequence is that important decisions never get made.
* where anger covers an underlying experience of guilt, ask yourself this question: “What is the rule for how I am supposed to be or act that I violated in this situation?”
* He counts her sins and transgressions like beads on a rosary of blame.
* Facing helplessness requires that you give up the crutch of blame. Anger won’t change anything. People will keep doing what they need to do, not what you need them to do. The first step in facing helplessness is to take full responsibility for being stuck right now. Look back at the specific choices you made, both to act and not to act, that led you to your current circumstances. Right now you need to accept that the ways you chose to cope, your game plan, your strategy for getting your needs met, fell short of the mark.
* It’s not cancer, you’re not getting fired, your son didn’t flunk out of college. It’s just an irritating moment in time—and it will soon be over.

Why We Lie: The Evolutionary Roots of Deception and the Unconscious Mind
************************************************************************

*Smith, David Livingstone*  (4294969620)

* Self-understanding does not come naturally to human beings, like eating, drinking, and having sex
* nature is awash with deceit.
* self-deception is the handmaiden of deceit
* Evolutionary biology implies that there is a region of our mind devoted to our dealings with other people that never divulges its secrets to conscious awareness.
* There is a side of ourselves that we were evolved not to know.
* Self-deception does not lend itself to experimental investigation,
* Evolutionary biology does not endorse the popular and reassuring conviction that human minds are tools for self-knowledge and the pursuit of truth
* The human mind evolved for the very same reason that all of our other organs evolved; namely, because it contributed to its owners’ reproductive success
* When we think of lying, we typically think of explicit verbal falsehoods. The philosopher Sissela Bok, who is a spokesperson for this view, defines a lie as any intentionally deceptive statement. 6 Is this all there is to lying? Mark Twain didn’t think so, and reckoned that “by examination and mathematical computation I find that the proportion of the spoken lie to the other varieties is 1 to 22,894. Therefore the spoken lie is of no consequence, and it is not worthwhile to go around fussing about it and trying to make believe that it is an important matter.”7 My own sympathies lie with Twain rather than with Bok, because Twain’s perspective is both inclusive and biologically realistic. As we saw with Paul and Mel, and we will see in chapter 2, deception is not the exclusive province of our species. Many other organisms make liberal use of deception to get their way. I therefore define lying as any form of behavior the function of which is to provide others with false information or to deprive them of true information.
* Twain, M. “My First Lie and How I Got Out of It.” In The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg and Other Stones and Sketches
* Socially appropriate lying is not merely tolerated, it is mandatory.
* Two thousand years ago Sun Tzu wrote in his handbook for generals that “All warfare is based on deception.
* Most controversially, he proposed that the part of the brain that thinks is entirely distinct from the part of the brain that is conscious.
* Freud, it is precisely the gap between cognition and consciousness, and the cognitive bouncer standing between them, that makes self-deception possible
* Introspection does not provide insight into the workings of the neural machinery that generates it any more than the display on a computer monitor provides a picture of the processes taking place within the processing unit
* information about our mental processes provided by introspection is highly unreliable
* diffusion of responsibility,” the assumption that someone else will help.
* Many mental health professionals promote the idea that depression and other emotional disorders stem in large measure from irrational thinking. Depressives, they claim, believe false ideas about themselves and others. They are self-deceived and out of touch with reality. Irrational, self-deceptive thinking is alleged to be a factor distinguishing depressed people from “normal” ones, but this psychiatric homily turns out to be badly mistaken.44 Scientific research leads to the opposite conclusion that depressives seem to have a better grasp of reality than the “normal” psychiatrists treating them. Lauren Alloy of Temple University in Philadelphia and Lyn Abramson of the University of Wisconsin designed an experiment in which one of the investigators secretly manipulated the outcome of a series of games. Both depressed and nondepressed subjects took part in these fixed games. Psychologists have long known that “normal” thinking involves an element of grandiosity: we tend to give ourselves credit when events work in our favor, but dish out the blame to others when they pan out to our disadvantage. True to form, the non-depressed subjects overestimated the degree to which they had personally influenced the outcome when the game was rigged so that they did well, and underestimated their own contribution to the outcome when they did poorly. Turning to the depressed subjects, Alloy and Abramson found that depressed individuals assessed both situations far more realistically. The rather startling conclusion is that depressives may suffer from a deficit in self-deception. Similar results were obtained by the distinguished behavioral psychologist Peter Lewinsohn, who found that depressed people are often able to judge others’ impressions of them more accurately than non-depressed subjects are. In fact, these people’s ability to make accurate interpersonal judgements degenerated as their depressive symptoms diminished in response to treatment.45 Others have found that high levels of self-deception are strongly correlated with conventional notions of mental health, and that subjects with so-called mental disorders evidence lower levels of self-deception than “normal” people.46 This research suggests (although, of course, does not conclusively prove) that “normality”—whatever that word means—may rest on a foundation of self-deception. Remove or undermine the foundation, and depression or other forms of emotional difficulty may emerge. If mental health depends upon a liberal dose of self-deception then perhaps, as the philosopher David Nyberg wryly remarks, “Self knowledge isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be.”47
* It is triply paradoxical that although we are the only animal that has evolved a mind with the remarkable power to scientifically analyze its own nature, this same mind has been configured by the forces of natural selection to oppose and dismiss the outcome of this investigation.
* But the reverse of truth has a hundred thousand forms, and a field indefinite, without bound or limit.
* Manipulating a creature by signals is a very different matter from manipulating it by force
* Human knowledge may be just a special case of the broader category of biological knowledge, the wisdom expressed in the innumerable ways that organisms are adapted to their environments.
* Darwinian theory is simple and elegant. It rests on three pillars: variation, selection, and reproduction
* Natural selection is a consequence of variations in fitness. It is easy to see how, given enough time, heritable fitness-enhancing traits will radiate through a population, squeezing out the competing alternatives. Characteristics are “selected” to survive in a vast, gruesome version of the game of musical chairs. Preferentially replicated successful traits, selected by nature to survive—at least for the present—are “adaptive” traits. In biological jargon, something is adaptive if it works as a solution to a problem in living.
* Natural selection holds sway even among species with dramatically lower mortality rates than the Pacific salmon and with more egalitarian sexual arrangements than the elephant seal. This is because any genetically heritable trait that differentially affects reproductive success, however incrementally, will, given sufficient time, inevitably spread. Darwin’s greatest achievement was to show how purely random variation could give the misleading impression of intentional design. Natural selection, as Richard Dawkins memorably put it, echoing and subverting Paley’s example, is a blind watchmaker.5
* Inheritance seems to operate digitally: its effects are either/or rather than both/and
* the reproductive success of organisms is not what drives evolution: it is the reproductive success of their genes.
* reciprocal altruism.”
* a linear increase in the size of a group results in an exponential increase in its social complexity.
* Either way, our bodies seem to sabotage our minds’ best efforts at deceit
* hiding aspects of reality from the conscious mind also hides these aspects more deeply from others. An unconscious deceiver is not expected to show signs of the stress associated with consciously trying to perpetrate deception
* Believing one’s own story makes it all the more persuasive.
* Second, we have to be somewhat more economical with lies than we are with the truth: lying all the time would be self-defeating. Aesop’s fable about the boy who cried wolf is an excellent lesson about what biologists call the “frequency-dependent” nature of deception.
* the biological function of self-deception is to deceive others,
* introspection gives us only a partial and misleading picture of our inner lives
* The Machiavellian mind is a partitioned mind with one sector open to the public and the other kept deeply private, so private, in fact, that even its owner does not suspect its existence.1 In short, there must exist an unconscious mind lying beyond the reach of introspection. Surprising as this may sound, scientists have been accumulating evidence for decades that demonstrates that introspection gives us only a partial and misleading picture of our inner lives. The scientific investigation of unconscious mental processes presents us with a map of the inner landscape far removed from reassuring commonsense views.
* Libet attached electrodes to monitor activity in his subjects’ motor cortex, the part of the brain that controls movement, so that he could measure the electrical tension that mounts as their brains prepared to initiate the action. Common sense would tell us that his subjects’ readiness potentials would begin to build as soon as, and no sooner than, they consciously decided to push the button. We are inclined to think this because we assume that it is the conscious decision to push the button that initiates the act of pushing the button. Libet found that this is not what happens. Our brains begin to prepare for action over a third of a second before we consciously decide to act. Although we go through life believing that decisions to act begin in consciousness, the experimental evidence suggests that this is a universally shared delusion.18
* Although we go through life believing that decisions to act begin in consciousness, the experimental evidence suggests that this is a universally shared delusion
* By this point, you have probably begun to realize that common sense is a rather poor guide to understanding the mind
* Investigators concluded that our brains process the semantic properties of language, the meaning of words and sentences, separately from its acoustic properties.
* Picture the mind as a funnel, with consciousness as the narrow end. No matter how much information pours into the wide end of the funnel, it can only pass through the spout at a slender trickle. The trickle of conscious thought is extraordinarily sluggish. Unconscious acts like choosing words to slot into a sentence, returning a tennis serve, scratching an itch, or slamming on the brakes of your car to avoid an accident are so fast that they are often finished by the time we become conscious of them.
* Like a computer monitor, consciousness neither does the cognitive work nor informs us about what is going on in the depths of the brain (the monitor shows only the results of the CPU’s efforts, not how they were obtained).
* Although Freud was not—and is not—alone in claiming that all thinking is unconscious, this idea remains controversial.31 Surely, there must be definitive evidence proving that at least sometimes we think consciously! Well, not really. Max Velmans, a cognitive scientist at the University of London, argues that voluminous experimental literature indicates that there is no credible scientific evidence that consciousness plays any role at all in cognitive processing. Consciousness may depict a mental process, or display the results of mental processing, but it does not do any of the cognitive work. The belief that we think consciously confuses the display with the real scene of action, like a small child who believes that there are little people inside the television set.32

* As it happens, facial symmetry correlates with fertility in women and sperm quality in men. The in-built nature of this preference is driven home by the fact that even small infants prefer looking at symmetrical faces.
* This pessimistic stance is understandable, if not entirely justified.
* By disguising our perceptions as memories, we are able to speak the unspeakable, to talk about the raw realities of social life while preserving the integrity of self-deception.
* Coded meanings have to be interpreted in order to be understood. This poses a problem because the very idea of interpretation has acquired an unsavory reputation among members of the scientific community.
* Wittgenstein and a number of philosophers after him argued that “meanings” are not entities tacked on to language, and that we do not give words meaning by simply assigning them in piecemeal fashion.
* The meaning of a word—or a sentence—is its use: words mean what words do
* o comprehend language we have to feel our way into it.
* People deliver unconscious messages in circumstances where it is important for them to determine the concealed intentions of other people, situations in which manipulation, misdirection, and self-deception are likely
* Sustained conscious insight is not an option for the human animal
* The power to deceive is our main weapon in the struggle for social survival. Like it or not, without it, we are sheep in the company of wolves.
* This is strong medicine, but there is more to come.
* Altruistic offers from people who are not blood relations, or with whom one does not share extensively overlapping interests, are biologically unrealistic and therefore suspect.
* It is a common social strategy to assemble as a coalition those who agree, or who can be persuaded to behave as though they agree, and then promote the apparent agreement of the subgroup as gospel.”
* they are the outcome of evolutionary arms races.
* In nature, every benefit comes at a cost
* Unconscious social intelligence is a faculty for detecting cheating and social predation
* This is the stuff that paranoid schizophrenia is made of
* “Peer leadership,” he writes, “tends to be rejected or resented.”
* While not neglecting broad themes, Haskell attends closely to the specific words chosen by the speaker. Number references, puns, and directional metaphors such as above or below have an important place in his approach to unconscious communication.
* There is nothing intrinsically bizarre about a number-crunching unconscious mind.
* In the natural sciences a person is remembered for his best idea; in the social sciences he is remembered for his worst,
* It is quite likely that many of the hypotheses proposed in this book will eventually turn out to be inaccurate. However, if we rejected theories because they might be wrong, we would not have any theories left. The notion that our ordinary social talk resembles intricately constructed poetry, and reveals cognitive abilities of which we are completely unaware is certainly strange, but since when does strangeness count against a theory? Scientific theories are often weird, because they reach beneath the surface of the world in an effort to grasp its inner workings. Accepting or rejecting psychological theories because of their “resonance” with the way that you feel yourself to be plays right into the hands of self-deception. The evolutionary perspective on self-deception entails there are some psychological theories that will never feel right because they address aspects of human nature that nature designed our minds to reject. It is explanatory and predictive power that makes a theory scientifically meaningful, and we will not have a clear verdict on the ideas described and advanced in this book until the day that they come under serious empirical scrutiny. If this happens and they are not vindicated, I will finally be liberated from the grip of a compelling illusion that has enthralled me for the last twenty years. Let the chips fall where they may.
* Let the chips fall where they may.
* He therefore decided to pour the acid of doubt over everything that he believed, to see what, if anything, remained undissolved
* Self-deception has been a wonderful gift, but it is now destroying us. Our taste for it resembles our craving for sugar and animal fat. These were good for our Stone Age ancestors, who had trouble finding enough nourishment to keep them alive and had to trek for hours each day to get it, but they are terrible for a sedentary, well-nourished population that need only drive down the road to get a fast-food fix.
* The most dangerous forms of self-deception are the collective ones. Patriotism, moral crusades, and religious fervor sweep across nations like plagues, slicing the world into good and evil, defender and aggressor, right and wrong. In the past, the mechanisms of group competition paid off. Self-righteous crusades vastly improved the quality of life for the victors and often for the defeated as well. Now, in the twenty-first century, it is likely that we will all be losers.

Strategy
********

*Freedman, Lawrence*  (4294968155)

* Having a strategy suggests an ability to look up from the short term and the trivial to view the long term and the essential
* to address causes rather than symptoms, to see woods rather than trees.
* He commented on demands for a “growth strategy” in the face of a stagnant and indebted economy but wondered who would claim a “rain strategy” as an answer to drought.
* There exist few modern circumstances,” he observed, “where the removal of the word ‘strategy’ from any passage containing it fails to clarify matters, usually demonstrating the argument’s circularity.
* By and large, strategy comes into play where there is actual or potential conflict, when interests collide and forms of resolution are required
* This is why a strategy is much more than a plan.
* A plan supposes a sequence of events that allows one to move with confidence from one state of affairs to another.
* Strategy is required when others might frustrate one’s plans because they have different and possibly opposing interests and concerns.
* the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong
* academics worry too much about making a good impression within their own disciplinary boundaries while not paying enough attention to what is going on beyond them.
* “the roots of politics are older than humanity.”
* Ants are among the most warlike of creatures.
* Their foreign policy has been described as “restless aggression, territorial conquest, and genocidal annihilation of neighboring colonies whenever possible.
* If ants had nuclear weapons, they would probably end the world in a week.”
* Ant warfare is in no sense strategic.
* It relies on relentless and ruthless attrition through brute force.
* There is no scope for bargaining and negotiation.
* sources of conflict as “improved access to resources such as food, females, or safety.”
* The most effective strategies do not depend solely on violence—though this can play an instrumental role, by demonstrating superiority
* God needed an obstinate Pharaoh because the only way he could demonstrate the full range of his power
* If Pharaoh had crumbled at the first plague there would have been no wondrous reports to pass down to future generations
* The trickster appeared defiant, employing “wit, wile, and deception and assum[ing] that no victories are final and neat.”
* Moses was following God’s orders and so was Pharaoh.
* In the end, the drama—and therefore the evidence of true strategy—was artificial.
* what it might mean to think as well as act strategically—not only in a military sense—were later played down and lost their impact.
* We can attribute this to the intervention of Plato.
* One of the curiosities of this literature is that some of its most interesting reflections on what it might mean to think as well as act strategically—not only in a military sense—were later played down and lost their impact. We can attribute this to the intervention of Plato. He was determined that philosophy should break decisively with the tendencies he lumped together as sophistry, which he saw as a diversion from a disinterested search for truth into a mercenary means of persuasion. There is some irony in that Plato’s method for disposing of sophistry, using exaggeration and caricature, was intensely strategic. Given the care with which he was studied by later generations, the importance of Plato’s success in this enterprise should not be underestimated.
* A preference for force or guile might reflect a temperamental disposition, but it could not be a strategy in itself
* Mētis described a particular notion of a strategic intelligence for which there is no obvious English equivalent. In Greek it was related to mētiaō: “to consider, meditate, plan,” together with metióomai, “to contrive,” conveyed a sense of a capacity to think ahead, attend to detail, grasp how others think and behave, and possess a general resourcefulness. But it could also convey deception and trickery, capturing the moral ambivalence around a quality so essential to the strategist’s art. According to the mythology, the goddess Mētis was chosen by Zeus as his first wife. Fearful that a son combining his strength with his mother’s intelligence would become too powerful, Zeus employed her own methods of deceit and surprise to avoid that risk and so ate her. He intended to control the source of all mētis forever when he swallowed Mētis. What he did not know was that Mētis was already pregnant, with a daughter Athena, who was born—fully formed—through Zeus’s head. Athena, the goddess of both wisdom and war, came to be associated with mētis more than the other divinities. She developed a close association with the mortal who most embodied mētis, Odysseus, the hero of Homer’s Odyssey. Athena described him as “far the best of all mortals in thought and word, and I’m renowned among all the gods for my wisdom and my cunning ways.”1
* Sinon was placed with Odysseus in Dante’s Eighth Circle of Hell, a place for those guilty of fraudulent rhetoric and falsification.
* In his epics, Homer contrasted mētis with biē, or brute force. Biē was personified by Achilles, famed for his exceptional physical strength, bravery, agility, and mastery of the spear, but also his great rages. While The Odyssey was about mētis, The Iliad was largely an exploration of biē. Achilles demonstrated not only the limits to what force could achieve but also how it could become associated with a certain wildness, a bloodlust that led to terrible deaths and slaughter. Yet it was hard to do without force. When Achilles gave up on the war against the Trojans after being slighted by King Agamemnon, it was Odysseus who led the delegation sent to plead with him. Achilles’s response was to denounce Odysseus and his methods: “I hate like the gates of Hades, the man who says one thing and hides another inside him.” Just as pointedly, Achilles drew attention to the failure of mētis to stop the Greeks being pushed back to the sea by the rampaging “man-killing” Hector, the equivalent Trojan superhero.
* For Odysseus, the ends justified the means
* The trickster was always prepared to be judged by results.
* He would prefer to “fail with honor” than to win by cheating.
* Rather than seeing reason and passion in opposition to one another, practical intelligence was about finding the appropriate relations between competing ends, each with an associated bundle of passions and reasons.
* Barnouw described this intelligence as being as much “visceral as intellectual,” less an “impassive weighing of alternatives,” and more a prioritizing of aims or impulses that are most desired. It reflected more “the strength and depth of passion as the work of reason.”
* Marcel Detienne and Jean-Pierre Vernant similarly argued that mētis as exemplified by Odysseus was a distinctive form of practical intelligence. More than being shrewd and crafty, it was also forward-looking, locating current actions as part of a longer-term plan, grasping the potential of situations so as to be able to manipulate others into error. This suggested a cast of mind as much as a plan of action, a way by which the underdog could triumph over the notionally stronger. Despite the association between mētis and the “disloyal trick, the perfidious lie, treachery,” it could also be “the absolute weapon, the only one that has the power to ensure victory and domination over others, whatever the circumstances, whatever the conditions of the conflict.” Whereas strength could be defeated by superior strength, mētis could defeat all strength.
* but “under the pressure of three of the strongest motives, fear, honor, and interest.”
* Athenians point out that “the strong do what they can while the weak must suffer what they must.
* In the language of later centuries, he sought victory through enemy exhaustion rather than annihilation.
* those with knowledge but not the “power clearly to express it” might as well have had no ideas at all.
* But actuality in the end proves unmanageable. It breaks in upon men’s conceptions, changes them, and finally destroys them
* Recklessness became courage, prudence became cowardice, moderation became unmanly, an ability to see all sides of a question became an incapacity to act,
* while violence became manly and plotting self-defense.
* They were hired hands, traveling wordsmiths who sold their skills to the highest bidder without any view of right and wrong
* Tricks with language allowed the foolish and ignorant to appear wise and knowledgeable.
* Just as children might be tricked into taking medicines or soldiers encouraged into battle, so communities had to be educated into a belief in social harmony and a conviction that the existing order was natural.
* one prepared to fall with honor and the other seeking to survive with deception.
* Thus the Roman historian Livy wrote of the more traditionally minded Senators’ distaste for a tendency toward “an excessively cunning wisdom.” This was akin to “Punic tricks and Greek craftiness, among whom it was more glorious to deceive an enemy than to conquer by force.” Romans would not wage war “through ambushes and nocturnal battles, nor through feigned flight and unforeseen returns upon a careless enemy.” On occasion there might be “more profit in trick than courage.” The spirit of an enemy, however, could only be truly suppressed by “open hand-to-hand combat in a just and righteous war,” rather than by “craft or accident.”1
* The spirit of an enemy, however, could only be truly suppressed by “open hand-to-hand combat in a just and righteous war,” rather than by “craft or accident
* In Sun Tzu’s formulaic aphorisms, the key to deception was simply a matter of doing the opposite of what was expected—look incapacitated when capable, passive when active, near when far, far when near

* By refusing to be pinned down or make an argument with sufficient clarity to be refuted, the initiative could be kept—although this could make for potentially infinite “games of manipulation

* Political survival depended on an unsentimental realism rather than the pursuit of an illusory ideal.
* In the nature of things you can never try to escape one danger without encountering another;
* but prudence consists in knowing how to recognize the nature of the different dangers and in accepting the least bad as good
* Men are so simple, and so much creatures of circumstance, that the deceiver will always find somebody ready to be deceived.
* The best power was that which had to be exercised least.
* could happen that reflected any will other than his. Humankind was just playing out a drama according to a script set down by God at the moment of creation, with no later need for improvisation
* As we have seen in Exodus, God could be deceptive and manipulative as part of his mysterious ways,
* Stratagems, as described by Frontinus, involved deceit, surprise, contrivance, obfuscation, and general trickery
* he preferred his wars to be “short and lively,”
* Long wars exhausted a state’s resources as well as its soldiers
* by fighting too often with one enemy, “you will teach him all your art of war”
* Napoleon never provided a complete account of his approach to war. He did not write of strategy, although he did refer to the “higher parts of war.” His views were recorded in a number of maxims. They were often practical reflections on the standard military problems of his day and lack the universal quality of Sun Tzu’s writings. Yet they capture the essence of his approach: bringing superior strength to bear at crucial moments (“God is on the side of the heaviest battalions”); defeating the enemy by destroying his army; viewing strategy as “the art of making use of time and space”; using time to gain strength when weaker; and compensating for physical inferiority with greater resolve, fortitude, and perseverance (“The moral is to the physical as three to one”). Many of his maxims revolved around the need to understand the enemy: by fighting too often with one enemy, “you will teach him all your art of war”; never do what the enemy wishes “for this reason alone, that he desires it”; never interrupt an enemy making a mistake; always show confidence, for you can see your own troubles but you cannot see those facing your enemy.12

Smart phone usage also doubled over this one-year period. By 2015 global mobile traffic is expected to increase 26-fold over 2010 levels, and it is expected that there will be nearly one mobile device per person—7.1 billion mobile connected devices for 7.2 billion individuals.19 The transformative potential underlying these numbers is best understood when we realize that 48 million of these individuals will live with mobile Internet access but without electricity.

In this section we clarify the concepts of risk and uncertainty to show how changes in the pace of innovation and globalization inherently create global fragilities.

This distinction is usually traced back to the seminal work of Frank Knight and is clearly articulated by Larry Epstein and Tan Wang, who distinguish risk as a decision-making circumstance in which “probabilities are available to guide choice.”37 In contrast, they define uncertainty as a circumstance in which “information is too imprecise to be summarized by probabilities.”38 Although contested, Knight’s distinction is the most widely accepted model and remains firmly embedded in decision theory.39 As we show in box 1.2, the distinction can be characterized in simple terms: risk is quantifiable and predictable. Uncertainty, on the other hand, encompasses unidentified and/or unexpected threats. For our analysis, it is also useful to consider an additional concept. The United Nations (UN) emphasizes the potential of “hazards” to show the cost of erroneous risk management. These are “latent conditions that may represent future threats”40 and thus are inherently linked to uncertainty.

* Hazard: A potentially damaging physical event or phenomenon that can harm people and their welfare.
* Vulnerability: A function of human actions and behavior that describes the degree to which a socioeconomic system is susceptible to the impact of hazards
* Risk: The probability of harmful consequences or the expected loss
* Risk = Hazard × Vulnerability.
* From this perspective, managing risk requires that causal connections between actions and events are or can be known. This becomes necessary for the construction of decision-making scenarios in which the consequences of actions may be anticipated.41 As our discussion of global complexity shows, the specification of contingencies becomes progressively more difficult as transport, communication, and financial and other world systems become increasingly integrated. This is because we start to lose sight of the effects of individual actions, introducing uncertainty and hazard. Given the pace of change, the traditional concepts of risk have become increasingly inappropriate as a basis of modern global governance.
* We advocate the analysis of systemic risk drawing on the tools designed for uncertain environments. Systemic risk refers to the prospect of a breakdown in the entire system as opposed to the breakdown of individual parts. Implicit in this definition, which is given in box 1.3, is the understanding that risk and uncertainty become more virulent in systems as the number of linkages grows. A “systemic risk” is a risk of a “common shock which is not the result of direct causation but … [of] indirect impacts.”42 This distinction is crucial because it underlines the fact that it is increasingly difficult to identify direct causality for outcomes. This distinguishes our analysis and recommendations from traditional risk management.

* More computing power implies greater complexity in code, increasing the potential for breaches of cybersecurity and also the potential for bugs. One of the earliest operating systems for personal computers—Windows NT 3.1, developed in 1993—had around 4.5 million lines of source code. By 2001 the number of source code lines in Windows XP had expanded to 40 million.13 The effects of growing complexity and reliance on computerization have been felt already. Knight Capital Group Inc. suffered a $440 million loss in 45 minutes after installing a new computer program with an unforeseen glitch to conduct trades on 1 August 2012.14 When Knight introduced the new program, it had had 17 years of experience and had settled around $20 billion in daily trades on the New York Stock Exchange. Errors occur not only due to poor programming or interfacing problems but also as the result of human interaction with computers. The most notorious of these mistakes are so-called fat-finger trades, which occur when a trader mistakenly enters the wrong amount for a trade, for example, by keeping a finger on the “0” key on the keypad and adding an additional order of magnitude. On 18 September 2012 a fat-finger trade caused major market volatility when the shares of Rowan Cos., National Oilwell Varco Inc., and other oil drillers and equipment manufacturers jumped between 3 and 9 percent.15 Relying heavily on computer systems carries the inherent risk of unanticipated errors and mistakes as well as increasing vulnerability to cyberfraud or cyberaggression.

Extreme complexity indicates that the effects are indeterminate and the corresponding hazards are unknown.

In light of the above arguments, one has to ask whether (stochastic) risk management is even appropriate in the face of complexity or whether banks should aim to manage uncertainty. Looking back on the factors leading to the financial crisis, it is evident that regulatory and supervisory institutions failed to detect or contain the systemic risks that accompanied the transformation of the financial sector. Market participants and regulators alike were not necessarily aware of the extent to which complexity and homogeneity intrinsically introduce fragility to networks. Despite all the data and resources at their command, even the most seasoned of bankers may well have been taken by surprise, as they have stated, when the connectivity that had enabled rapid growth suddenly turned to amplifying and spreading systemic risks. Had the regulators been aware of what was happening, a separate question is whether they would have been able to do anything about it given their lack of power, particularly over the largest countries (such as the United States) and the largest banks.

* The second dimension of systemic risk in infrastructure is that, as well as creating a risk of cascading failures, globalization has increased the vulnerability of these critical nodes. As many infrastructure systems become outdated and are undermonitored, they become more vulnerable. High-volume traffic means that there is little time for maintenance. Meanwhile, the international nature of these nodes makes national regulation incomplete and less effective. These two risks can be illustrated simply: complexity means that a failure at one node (for example, an airport) is likely to have systemic consequences that could easily affect multiple sectors of the economy, multiple countries, and millions of only indirectly connected global citizens. Vulnerability means that this one node is more likely to fail.

* We also do not understand the complex interactions between, for example, biodiversity and food or among the atmosphere and oceans and our weather system
* Environmental risk is different from risks arising from finance in that it is characterized by the interaction of man-made and natural systems. Our primary concern with man-made networks is that they reliably continue to work so that the structures they support will continue to run. In the case of environmental risk, the task of repairing networks and developing resilience in them is much more challenging given the complexity and long-term evolution of the systems. We cannot reproduce fossil fuels or recapture carbon as easily as we rebuild a bridge or re-erect a power line. We also do not understand the complex interactions between, for example, biodiversity and food or among the atmosphere and oceans and our weather systems. Our concern, therefore, should be with preserving rather than recreating or replacing existing systems. The risks to and from the environment have escalated with globalization, not least because, while the spillovers of actions beyond national borders are rising rapidly, the capacity for collective action to address them is lagging further and further behind.
* “globalization facilitates the relocation of dirty industry to poor countries

* in most cases integration into the world economy increases income inequality.
* Some studies, for example, appear to show that “rising imports from developing countries are associated with declining income inequality in advanced countries.”
* In contrast, the evidence of the relationship between globalization and global income inequality appears to be ambiguous and, more important, sensitive to the choice of the sample. As Figure 7.3 shows, at the individual level there are wide income differentials, even between the citizens of countries that would not necessarily be at the bottom of the income distribution when ranked by country averages. Owing to their static nature, however, these comparative data have little to say about the development of individual inequality over time, and thus about the causal impact of globalization. Commenting on the corresponding dynamics, Branko Milanović finds that “the world today presents a peculiar picture where some of its parts are immensely richer than ever in history while other parts have an income level about the same as it was 150 or even 500 years ago.” He also asserts that “even when we contrast the fast-growing ‘emerging economies’ of China and India with the rich world, the gap in the first decade of the 21st century is greater than it was around 1850.”26 Based on this evidence, it seems that the picture at the global scale resembles what we have reported for national inequality: more globalization seems to be associated with a more unequal world. This long-term historical trend is even more remarkable if we acknowledge that the rapid growth and integration of some of the poorest and most populous economies (most notably those of China and India) have actually reduced global inequality and encouraged convergence in recent times.27

Mojo: How to Get It, How to Keep It, How to Get It Back if You Lose It
**********************************************************************

*Marshall Goldsmith*  (4294968044)

* Mojo is that positive spirit toward what we are doing now that starts on the inside and radiates to the outside
* Mojo    is that positive spirit    toward what we are doing    now    that starts from the inside    and radiates to the outside.
* People who love what they’re doing but somehow never show it are doomed to be misunderstood.
* people who hate what they’re doing but manage to paint a convincing picture of positive spirit on the outside are phonies—and their inauthentic act usually catches up with them.
* sometimes no matter how positive we feel about what we’re doing, we fail at showing it on the outside. We are so focused on completing our task that we assume people can read what’s in our hearts and minds. We think our good intentions should be obvious. They can’t possibly be misconstrued.
* Our default response in life is not to experience happiness.         Our default response in life is not to experience meaning.         Our default response in life is to experience inertia.
* My candid answer was “I don’t know.” Although I had been conducting these sessions for years with dozens of companies, I had never followed up with my clients to see if, later on, they actually took the sessions to heart, did as I’d instructed, and became more effective leaders. So I began going back to many of my clients and assembled data that answered the question, “Does anyone ever really change?” Our original follow-up study included 86,000 respondents. Our database has grown to more than 250,000 respondents. My conclusion is now unequivocal. Very few people achieve positive, losting change without ongoing follow-up. Unless they know at the end of the day (or week or month) that someone is going to measure if they’re doing what they promised to do, most people fall prey to inertia. They continue doing what they were doing. They don’t change their behavior, and as a result, they don’t become more effective. On the other hand, if they know someone, like their coach, their coworkers, or their manager, is watching—in the form of paying attention to them, or caring about them, or evaluating them with follow-up questions—they’re more likely to change.\* The key is measurement and follow-up, in all their myriad forms.
* This tug of war between our past and future selves, not surprisingly, can leave heads spinning as we veer between the comfort of our past self and the unknown promise of a future self.
* There’s nothing wrong with harkening back to the past to sort out your strengths and weaknesses. But cling too tightly and you might be getting it all wrong, creating a dark blurry picture of someone who doesn’t exist anymore.
* Other people remember events in your past and they remind you of them, sometimes constantly.
* We cannot wish physical reality away with “positive thinking.”
* One of the greatest obstacles to changing our Mojo is here—in the paralysis we create with self-limiting definitions of who we are.
* Both Professional and Personal Mojo are connected to achievement—just two different types of achievement.
* You value your achievements based on how good you feel about yourself and what you’re doing.
* Think of your own definition of “achievement.” What matters to you? What matters to the world? Be honest with yourself. Look in the mirror. Make peace with your true motivations. Try not to go through life deluding yourself by pretending that when the world cares, you do—or pretending that when the world does not care, you do not care.
* Brain Pill Question
* Personally, I wouldn’t take the pill. It’s not that I’m smug and self-satisfied with my brainpower as is. It’s that I don’t feel that the incremental gain of 10 percent in smarts is worth the 20 percent reduction in how my intelligence is perceived by the world. All I’ve done is create a 30 percent gap between how smart I think I am and what everyone else thinks. That’s a big gap, providing a major blow to my reputation and an unwelcome load of professional frustration. After all, what’s more frustrating than believing you’re smart, yet being powerless to impact a world that believes you are not?
* Partly because of my reputational goal, many decisions in my career boil down to: Will it make me look smarter or make me become more effective? I always vote for effective. I’m not looking to be known as the smartest person with the most sophisticated theory about helping people change. I want to be known as the guy who is actually very effective at helping people change.
* Because we don’t keep track of our repeat behavior, we never see the patterns that others see. These are the patterns that shape our reputation—and yet we’re largely oblivious to them and, in turn, to our reputation.
* The truth is, reputation doesn’t happen overnight. In the same way that one event can’t form your reputation, one corrective gesture can’t reform it either. You need a sequence of consistent, similar actions to begin the rebuilding process.
* “I’ll be happy when…” is a very Western way of thinking. We believe that achieving a goal will somehow make us happy, conveniently ignoring the fact that the goal line always moves slightly beyond our
* worrying about the past and being anxious about the future can easily destroy our Mojo. It upsets us emotionally. It clouds our judgment. It fills us with regret. And it can lead to self-punishment.
* When we cannot accept a situation for what it is and we refuse to forgive people for causing that situation, who do we ultimately hurt? The answer is always the same: ourselves.
* Getting upset with other people for being who they are makes as much sense as kicking a chair for being a chair. Your chair cannot help but be a chair. Neither can the people who upset you. They’re being who they are. (If you had their parents, their genes, their résumé, you might be them too.) You don’t have to like them, agree with them, or even respect them. Just accept them for being who they are.
* If we chronically over-commit, our sagging spirit inside may well become manifestly obvious to everyone. Our formerly enjoyable job can become rote, our execution sloppy and halfhearted. The irony of all this—that our habit of over-committing (in time) has produced the unintended consequence of making us appear under-committed (in spirit)—is rarely appreciated by our customers or our colleagues
* When people wait for discomfiting facts to change into something more to their liking, they’re basically engaging in wishful thinking. It’s the opposite of over-committing because it leads to under-acting (or under-committing and not acting at all). Instead of doing something, you’re frozen in place while you wait for a more comforting set of facts to appear. In a world that’s constantly rushing forward, this is akin to moving backward. That’s a Mojo killer.
* Once we “logical thinkers” make peace with the fact that all decisions are made by real people—not logical computers—life gets easier, we make more of a positive difference, and we are happier.
* If you’re looking for your own view of logic to win the day, you may be looking in the wrong place. If you focus on making a positive difference, instead of just being satisfied with feeling “objective,” you will benefit both your company and your career. You may ultimately increase, rather than damage, your Mojo.
* The next time you start to bash the boss, think about what you may be doing to your own Mojo and the Mojo of the people around you. If you really have a problem with bosses, talk to them about it. If you feel that you cannot talk with them, leave. If you cannot talk with them, and cannot leave, revisit our chapter on “acceptance” and make the best of it.
* the vast majority of human beings enjoy expressing these opinions. In fact, we like to see this as our righ
* When we think we’re not being heard, we tend to shout even louder—which is about the time others cover their ears or run out of the room.
* Decision-makers make decisions. It doesn’t mean they are right, or fair, or deeply care about our feelings. It only means that some other person decides—and we don’t. Arguing that inequity won’t change the outcome.
* A lot of us, especially if we work for other people rather than for ourselves, have forgotten that we have the choice to set our own goals. Instead, we operate under criteria handed to us by others that lure us into mindlessly running with the herd. When this happens, we rarely take the opportunity to set our own criteria.
* What’s strange is that most of us in business apply criteria to people all the time. We do it when we hire someone to work for
* A bigger question is why don’t we apply the same rigor to the people up and down the food chain who can profoundly influence our careers and happiness? Why don’t we have “hiring criteria” for the kind of boss we’re willing to work for, or the clients we’ll take on, or the colleagues we partner up with on a project? The biggest question is why don’t we apply the same vigor to ourselves
* Establish Criteria That Matter to You
* In analyzing our relationship to our work—how we’re spending it professionally and personally—all of us, consciously or not, run everything through two filters: short-term satisfaction (or happiness) and long-term benefit (or meaning). Both ha
* The point is, two people engaged in the same activity can have completely different perceptions of what the activity means to them. It’s important to remember this as many of us face one of the most disruptive, turbulent work environments in decades. Suddenly, one person’s surviving is another’s succeeding—and vice versa.
* Our findings have also shown that, for the majority of people, the only way to increase overall satisfaction with life (both at work and outside work) is to increase both happiness and meaning. (See Appendixes I and II to review the Mojo Survey and read about some of our initial findings.)
* Why do people give up?
* In a world where addition is the customary method of rewarding ourselves—more money, more things, more friends, more productivity, more fun—subtraction is not the most obvious success strategy, or the first tool we reach for in our Mojo Tool Kit. But it can reshape our world in ways we cannot imagine.
* ake it bird by bird.”When we feel that we’ve lost our Mojo, the thought of restoring it can seem a daunting task, as fearsome and paralyzing as the task faced by a child who must write a report that he has put off until the last minute. We don’t know where to begin, we wish we had more time, we cannot see the finish line, and we have no confidence that we can reach it.
* Birds or bricks (what is it about goal-setting that calls up metaphors?)—it doesn’t matter what imagery you employ to get started and keep going, the concept is the same: You’re aiming for serial achievements. In order to show people who you are now, you can’t rely on one-off gestures. They end up looking like stunts. (Imagine a rude coworker who’s suddenly nice to you. The first time this happens you wonder, Huh? What got into him? The second time becomes a signal to pay attention. The third time a pattern begins to form in your mind. It’s only until the nice behavior is repeated a dozen or more times in a row, without any flare-ups of rudeness, that you begin to accept that the change is real.) You have to string successes together. If you provide people with continuity, however trivial or feeble, they will notice. When they see a pattern of repeat positive behavior, they begin to understand what you’re doing—and they accept a new you. This is how reputations are rebuilt. (Remember, brick walls are made up of lots of bricks.)

* What I’d like to suggest here is that measuring the “bad numbers” is precisely what we need to do more often.

Applying personal metrics when the numbers may be depressing not only tells us where we’re failing but also how to change our luck.

Management: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)
****************************************************************

*John Hendry*  (4294969216)

* people work best when they are happy, appreciated, and can trust in the integrity and fairness of their managers,
* and that this is especially so when organizations are under pressure and performance is critical.
* A central concept here is rationality, or the power of reason. Of all the extraordinary abilities that humans possess, the power of reason is probably the most extraordinary. Together with its emotive counterpart, sympathy or human-heartedness, it defines what it means to be human. Its fruits are most strikingly evident in the achievements of science and technology: in computing and communications technologies, biotechnology, medicine, and so on. But it’s also a core aspect of everyday life. We may not be great at it, but most of us can argue in a logical, seemingly objective way from premises to conclusions. We can critically assess each other’s claims and arrive at sophisticated, evidence-based judgements. And we can formulate and execute complex plans in order to achieve our objectives.
* Together with its emotive counterpart, sympathy or human-heartedness, it defines what it means to be human. I
* Reason also has a nasty habit of running out on us when things get really important
* for example, whether God exists
* We cannot rationally deduce something from nothing.
* rationality rules, but in a very compromised form.
* Turning to managing, or the practice of management, the rational limitations of humans, whether managers or managed, are only too evident. Contrary to the economists’ assumptions, people are not perfectly competent. Indeed they are notoriously incompetent. They are, as we sometimes say, ‘only human.’ They forget things, get distracted, lose concentration, make mistakes, and get carried away by their emotions. Even the most competent managers have to cope with the human failings (if failings they are) of the people who report to them, as well as with the essential uncertainties of the situations with which they are faced. Managers always have access to more information than they can possibly process, but they never have the information they need to plan with confidence. They face unknown and in many ways quite unknowable futures. And in a business context they face the inherent uncertainties of competition. Reason can help here. As Herbert Simon noted, a rational response to uncertainty, for example, is to limit your research and analysis, make some ‘reasonable’ working assumptions, and get on with things, rather than trying to analyse every conceivable eventuality. But reason alone will never be enough, and especially when dealing with other people the most rational approach won’t always be the most effective.
* rather than trying to analyse every conceivable eventuality.
* not because the assumptions reflect reality but because the model itself is more robust than the specific assumptions used to derive it
* when we apply theories with strong assumptions to practice, the assumptions can easily become self-fulfilling.
* The basic recipe here is simple: minimize the damage (and make sure that the innocent are exonerated), maximize the learning, and act in the best interests of the organization.
* An effective manager is in control, albeit not completely and often not overtly
* The oldest and simplest approach to management is to tell people what to do and make sure they do it, if necessary by using violence or the threat of violence
* Max Weber, identified and distinguished between three forms of ‘legitimate authority,’ or three ways in which authority that might be socially grounded and legitimated within a social group.
* The first type of authority in Weber’s scheme is traditional authority, resting on a belief in the sanctity of long-standing traditions and, in particular, on the legitimacy of the social status of th
* The second type is charismatic authority, resting on admiration of the qualities of a particular individual and a consequent devotion to that individual, and obedience to the rules or norms proclaimed
* The third type is rational or legal authority, resting on acceptance of the legal basis of rules and of the rights of duly appointed people to enforce them.
* Weber stressed that these were analytical ‘ideal types’ and that any real-world situation was likely to entail combinations of the different types, as well as combinations of consensually and coercively exercised authority
* Historians of management generally distinguish between two different approaches to the challenges it poses. One approach is rational. The organization is seen as in some sense a machine, and the principal task of management as to design, engineer, and maintain that machine. Workers, in this approach, are seen either as simple cogs in the machine or as atomized individuals on the economic model, motivated primarily by financial self-interest. The other approach is variously described as human, organic, or normative. The organization is seen as a living organism bound together by personal relationships, and the workers are seen as having complex and interconnected needs and motivations. The principal task of management, in this approach, is to release the human potential of the workers so that the organization can benefit precisely from the fact that they are not mere cogs in a machine or atomized self-interested utility maximizers.
* Mayo’s eventual conclusion was that output was determined less by working conditions or incentive systems than by the informal social pattern of the work group.
* Herbert Maslow proposed a hierarchy of needs, ranging from basic physiological needs up to self-actualization, and suggested that once a level of needs had been met, it ceased to act as a positive motivator
* These audit regimes are partly an attempt to control managers’ new freedoms and partly a means of allocating blame when the attempt fails
* These audit regimes are partly an attempt to control managers’ new freedoms and partly a means of allocating blame when the attempt fails, and in the latter guise they run through contemporary society. When responsibility becomes individualized rather than shared, people seek to pass it on, and one consequence is that private sector managers are also faced with a heavy burden of externally imposed regulations, especially in areas such as health and safety. If an employee foolishly stands on a chair and falls off, it can no longer be treated as a silly accident. The organization becomes legally liable and the manager slack enough to let such a thing happen becomes accountable. Rather bizarrely, major financial misdemeanours seem to be less troubling, as the large accounting firms responsible for financial audits, themselves embracing the enterprise culture and hungry for fees, have shown themselves repeatedly to be effectively buyable by their clients.
* aimed for insight rather than academic rigour,
* concentrating on the bare facts rather than seeking to contextualize them.
* On Hofstede’s measures, Americans have a much shorter-term orientation than respondents from most other cultures.
* The past is virtually an irrelevance and the future is distant.
* While Americans tend to focus on the very short term, and so do not worry about future uncertainties, the Chinese orientation is so long term that the uncertainties of the present and near future can be dismissed as merely transient.
* while American managers select individuals for a team, Japanese managers make a team from the individuals they are given—and then take collective responsibility for its actions.
* The Japanese word for ‘objectivity,’ literally translated, is ‘the guest’s point of view.’
* Middle and junior managers, however, have done less well, and arguably find themselves exploited in much the same way as blue-collar workers have been in the past.
* Democracy in an Age of Corporate Colonization
* managerialism also carries with it the seeds of its own demise.
* What appear on the face of it to be natural, necessary, and self-evident features of a social order are social and political constructions, which naturalize and universalize particular class interests.
* In the modern corporation, as in modern society more generally, it is argued, means-oriented reasoning lays claim to the whole space of reason, excluding morality, judgement, and the give and take of reasonable dialogue
* critical management scholars have pointed to the ways in which seemingly objective criteria such as those of rationality and efficiency are to some extent socially and politically determined.
* The way we make sense of things is by fitting them into a narrative or story.
* Each story highlights something important, but at the cost of hiding or denying something equally important.
* since we never have a perfect knowledge of the facts, plausibility is more important than accuracy.
* An important characteristic of sense-making is that it is retrospective
* we can only pay attention to something once it has happened, and we can’t really understand even what we’re doing ourselves until after we’ve done it.
* trial juries do not agree on what facts are important and then reach a verdict, but reach a verdict first and then agree on which facts are important.
* Our lives are dominated by relationships of kinship and friendship that develop relatively slowly, and in which meaning is collectively shared and rarely challenged.
* Only when something quite dramatic happens, socially, politically, or emotionally, does sense-making come to the foreground.
* in a competitive environment, a good understanding of yesterday’s problems is unlikely to impress.
* What is called for is an understanding of today’s problems, however imperfect that might be
* In an organizational setting, sense-making is consequently more likely to proceed from action. You act and then, having acted, construct a story to justify the action and make sense of it for those around you.
* e solving a problem, however, you first have to formulate it, and that is arguably the real management challenge.
* With no sense-making story on which to rely, they lose their ability to act and simply do as they are told.
* Just as we are often told that any decision is better than no decision, so any map or framework is better than no map or framework
* Once a particular ‘sense’ of things becomes established and shared there is always a tendency, in any context, for any new evidence or new events to be interpreted according to the established story
* New events that might signal to an outsider the need for change are either ignored or interpreted, and if necessary reinterpreted, as confirming the existing view of things—or at most some modest adjustment to that view
* It takes a major shock, a severe dissonance, to force a change of view.

Singletasking

* Fragmented attention (aka multitasking) fractures results
* At any given time, you can do one thing well or two things poorly
* Humans don’t really multitask, we task-switch
* Although there are instances when engaging in two noncompeting activities can be beneficial, choose carefully.
* Engaging in two noncompeting activities when at least one is automatic is generally harmless
* pursuing competing tasks can exact a very high toll.
* capacity to apply knowledge from one context to another is called transference.
* Attempts to multitask reduce this ability.
* Regardless of age, we understand and recall less when task-shifting.

One lesson I learned at the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School for Communication was that the media can’t tell you what to think, but it can tell you what to think about.

It’s really great fun to go someplace where there are no timesaving devices because, when you do, you find you have lots of time. Elsewhere, you’re too busy working to pay for machines to save you time so you won’t have to work so hard.

Blind Spots: Why Smart People Do Dumb Things
********************************************

*Madeleine L. Van Hecke*  (4294969467)

* pinnacle of rationality is reached by age five and goes rapidly downhill after that
* . We attribute the worst possible motives to our opponents and place the most negative interpretations upon their actions.
* If we think twice before condemning others, we have a chance of helping them recognize what’s gone wrong
* there is a big difference between shame and moral guilt, because moral guilt can be atoned for, while shaming makes us feel utterly soiled and offers no way to redeem ourselves.
* We fail to think because we are snowed under by the sheer amount of new information that we are trying to take in.
* An old Chinese proverb says, “The fish is the last to know that it is in water.”
* When we see the world only through the lens of our own needs, we will be trapped and blind to the perspectives of other people.
* Like companies that automatically review sales at regular intervals, or have managers attend annual retreats or training sessions, we can plan “time-outs” to think about what is happening in our lives. Instead of being the fish who is the last to know that it is in water, we can be the fish who periodically jumps out of the water in order to see and reflect on what we’ve been swimming in
* Reflection is only one part of the rhythm; the other part is immersion in the experience itself.
* Our belief that we know the answer blinds us to our ignorance.
* Like Dr. Gajdusek, we all accept many of the prevailing ideas of our time and our culture. We couldn’t possibly call each of these into question and investigate its validity before we would accept it. And once we believe that we know the right answer to a question, we don’t naturally pursue other possibilities. Creativity expert Roger von Oech describes an exercise in which there are many possible answers, which are all equally correct.3 In using this exercise, von Oech is trying to point out that most of us, most of the time, stop at “the first right answer” because we believe that it is The Answer.
* Most of us learn, at quite a young age, that we’ll be judged dumb if we’re ignorant of information that others expect us to know.
* We do this because we’ve learned that those who are in the know treat those who don’t get it disdainfully.
* Faced with the possibility of being mocked by others, most people need to protect their image of themselves as intelligent. But to belittle the knowledge of others in an attempt to prop up our faith in our own intelligence isn’t particularly constructiv
* two handy questions ready for anyone who treats her as stupid when she is simply ignorant of information. The questions are: (1) How would I know that? and (2) How did you learn that?
* Rarely do we step back from the thoughts we have in order to make them the object of our scrutiny. As a result, we fail to notice both how we think and what we are thinking about.
* Because most of us rarely eavesdrop on our own minds to find out what we’re thinking, we have to make some effort to discover what we really think, believe, or feel about a situation or an idea. I’m not referring here to the effort needed to discover the kinds of deeply hidden, unconscious thoughts, feelings, and motives that Freud proposed are at the root of much of our psychological distress. I’m talking about material that is easily available to us. Our conscious thoughts, feelings, and beliefs often pass undisguised through our minds. They emerge clearly in our awareness, but only briefly. Like footprints on a shore, they are washed away by the next wave—the next thought, feeling, or external distractio
* That’s why we seek out friends who can be sounding boards. In our conversations with them, we are able to discover not so much what they think, though that may be valuable, but what we think.
* When one sensory mode is more dominant for us than another, it’s as if everything we experience in the world comes through a filter
* You, too, might discover that what you’re really like is different from the self-image that you ordinarily spend lots of energy and effort maintainin
* You are certainly more complex than any oversimplified version of someone who must deny a lot of his or her humanity in order to live up to impossible standards.
* We won’t discover other options unless we overcome the blind spot we have about our own power
* Yet we’ve all seen people who appear to have grown older without growing much wiser
* Wisdom comes when we allow experience to transform us rather than merely inform us
* A father orders college catalogs for his son in hopes that the boy will choose one of the better colleges. The father sees this as an act of caring; the son condemns it as controlling. A daughter lies over the phone to her mother’s boss so that he won’t find out that her mom is too drunk to go to work. The daughter sees her lie as an act of loyalty; a counselor laments it is enabling her mother’s drinking. As psychologist David Levy points out, the very language we choose not only reflects the different interpretations we make of other people’s behavior but also implies our moral judgments.4 Is the other person greedy or ambitious? Pushy or assertive? Rigid or steadfast? Intrusive or concerned?
* ? To overcome this blind spot, we have to set aside our natural inclination to define problems in terms of our own experience and instead understand them in terms of the other person’s perspective
* Empathy requires two elements: a genuine caring about the other person and the ability to see the world through the other person’s eyes
* they might be jeopardizing the values that they held most precious, including the ethical system or faith to which they adhered.
* They had the intuition that the more clearly they were able to grasp the pole apart, the more difficult it might be for them to judge that perspective as wrong.
* It is possible for us to go to great lengths to understand perspectives different from our own without necessarily endangering the moral compass that guides us.
* t the ground shifted, but the foundations of their worlds didn’t crumble entirely
* Our ability to categorize creates blind spots because classification systems are inherently reductionistic
* Classification flattens our perception of individuals if we see them solely in terms of their group memberships
* They presuppose, he writes, “that ‘deep down inside’ everyone there is just one affiliation that really matters, a kind of ‘fundamental truth’ about each individual, an ‘essence’ determined once and for all at birth... [as if everything else that followed]—in short his life itself—counted for nothin
* The child we classify as male or female, African American or Caucasian or Hispanic or Asian, won’t be diminished by that label unless we reduce the child to nothing but that group—and reduce that group to nothing but a caricature of it.
* most of us are unaware of the metaphors that underlie our reasoning
* closed puzzles versus messy problems
* we tend to accept unquestioningly the statistics that support the causes we advocate and to reject out-of-hand statistics that support an opposing view.
* We human beings have a bias to seek only confirming evidence
* psychologists report that creative people are more able to live with ambiguity than the rest of us are.
* “Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.”
* As adults, we continue to use this sort of reasoning; it’s effective in many situations. But it also has flaws. The first of these is that it’s too simplistic. When we think in this way, we act as if a single, apparent, and immediate cause can account for what occurs. As adults, we know that a single cause is often inadequate to explain what happens. The folk saying about the final straw that broke the camel’s back reflects our hunch that an accumulation of minor incidents can cause major events, ones that could not be explained if we focused only on the final event that was the last straw. Yet we often lose sight of the fundamental idea of multiple causation and instead accept a simplistic explanation for what has happened.
* We search for causes using the simple method of asking what happened earlier
* Our blind spots are often caused by our narrow focus
* When we focus too narrowly on the most obvious and most immediate causes, we fail to accurately identify what’s causing what
* pplying our knowledge of the different causal relationships that can occur, we can ask:               • And finally, that all-important question: Is it possible that the coincidence of A, B, and C is simply a fluke—that these events really have nothing to do with one another?
* Because we don’t naturally think in terms of systems, a major antidote to the blind spot of missing the big picture is to intentionally consider how a system as a whole may affect the smaller detail that is our current focus
* it is extremely demoralizing to be blamed for outcomes that are essentially out of our control because they result from policies or constraints imposed by the larger system
* Consider the Law of Unintended Consequences
* Rarely is the bigger picture a stagnant map of a stationary area, like a map that shows how our front door is connected to our back door. Instead, it is more like an ecological system that is in constant flu
* Thinking on this top rung of the abstraction ladder is not easy. This sort of thinking involves what Margaret Donaldson calls “disembedded reasoning”—reasoning without the supportive context of meaningful events
* The most direct path to discovering our blind spots is to intentionally bring perspectives other than our own to the table
* the old wave of values, assumptions, and habits of thought that have “harbored racism, tolerated injustice, nurtured patriarchy, presided over the rape of the planet, and refined the art of war.”

Talent Is Overrated
*******************

*Geoff Colvin*  (4294968226)

* IQ is a decent predictor of performance on an unfamiliar task, but once a person has been at a job for a few years, IQ predicts little or nothing about performance.
* what the research suggests very strongly is that the link between intelligence and high achievement isn’t nearly as powerful as we commonly suppose.
* people who do what Rubin did aren’t changing their personalities, they’re changing their behavior in order to override some part of their personalities
* “The conviction in the importance of talent appears to be based on the insufficiency of alternative hypotheses to explain the exceptional nature of expert performers.”
* “the differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain.”
* ormer chief of General Electric’s famous Crotonville management development center, illustrates the point by drawing three concentric circles. He labels the inner circle “comfort zone,” the middle one “learning zone,” and the outer one “panic zone.” Only by choosing activities in the learning zone can one make progress. That’s the location of skills and abilities that are just out of reach. We can never make progress in the comfort zone because those are the activities we can already do easily, while panic-zone activities are so hard that we don’t even know how to approach them.
* practicing without feedback is like bowling through a curtain that hangs down to knee level. You can work on technique all you like, but if you can’t see the effects, two things will happen: You won’t get any better, and you’ll stop caring.
* Deliberate practice “is not inherently enjoyable.”
* Frequently when we see great performers doing what they do, it strikes us that they’ve practiced for so long, and done it so many times, they can just do it automatically. But in fact, what they have achieved is the ability to avoid doing it automatically.
* By contrast, great performers never allow themselves to reach the automatic, arrested-development stage in their chosen field
* It’s certainly true that a great performer is able to do many things in his or her field with far fewer mental demands than a novice performer; an excellent pilot lands a 747 without breaking a sweat. But ultimately the performance is always conscious and controlled, not automatic.
* Just as top tennis players look at the server’s body, not at the tennis ball, excellent performers in other fields have learned to spot nonobvious information that’s important
* Much of the power of looking further ahead comes from the simple act of raising one’s gaze and getting a new perspective, and doing it not once or occasionally, but using practice principles to do it often and get better at it.
* The most important ingredient in any expert system is knowledge,”
* As it happened, other researchers were arriving at the same place by  a different route, though they also were studying chess. A Dutch psychologist named Adriaan de Groot compared world-class players with good club-level players and found, surprisingly, that the world-class players didn’t consider more possible moves than the less-accomplished players, nor did they search any deeper (more moves into the future), nor were their rules of thumb for choosing moves any different. In sum, their intellectual engines didn’t seem to be turning any faster
* In general, the knowledge of top performers is integrated and connected to higher-level principles.
* When Jeff Immelt became GE’s chief in 2001, he launched a study of the best-performing companies worldwide—those that had grown much faster than the economy for many years and had produced excellent returns for shareholders. What did they have in common? One key trait the study found was that these companies valued “domain expertise” in managers—extensive knowledge of the company’s field.
* That finding applies generally: Top performers understand their field at a higher level than average performers do, and thus have a superior structure for remembering information about it.
* In the letters-versus-words analogy, it isn’t just that novices see letters while experts see words; the experts also know the meanings of the words.
* Step one, obvious yet deserving a moment’s consideration, is knowing what you want to do. The key word is not what, but knowing. Because the demands of achieving exceptional performance are so great over so many years, no one has a prayer of meeting them without utter commitment. You’ve got to know what you want to do, not suspect it or be inclined toward it or be thinking about it. In the final chapter we’ll look more closely into the mysterious question of where that commitment comes from. For now we’ll assume that you’re settled on what you want to achieve, even if it’s only the next step in a general direction.
* The practice routine is to study a particular position and choose the move you would make, then compare it with the move chosen by the master; if they’re different, figure out why and which is better.
* The best performers set goals that are not about the outcome but about the process of reaching the outcome.
* The most important self-regulatory skill that top performers use during their work is self-observation
* The best performers observe themselves closely. They are in effect able to step outside themselves, monitor what is happening in their own minds, and ask how it’s going. Researchers call this metacognition—knowledge about your own knowledge, thinking about your own thinking. Top performers do this much more systematically than others do; it’s an established part of their routine
* Research confirms what common sense tells us, that too high a standard is discouraging and not very instructive, while too low a standard produces no advancement.
* As you add to your knowledge of your domain, keep in mind that your objective is not just to amass information. You are building a mental model—a picture of how your domain functions as a system. This is one of the defining traits of great performers: They all possess large, highly developed, intricate mental models of their domains
* A mental model forms the framework on which you hang your  growing knowledge of your domain
* We’ve seen how top performers can reach into their long-term memory in ways that ordinary performers can’t, and how it isn’t because they have exceptional memories but because they have exceptional knowledge of their domain
* Most important, a mental model enables you to project  what will happen next
* A mental model is never finished
* In fact, the principles of great performance can help improve such organizations to the point where they might actually dare to think about greatness.
* Understand that each person in the organization is not just doing  a job, but is also being stretched and grown
* Develop teams, not just individuals.
* “I’m not lookin’ for the best players, Craig. I’m lookin’ for the right p
* trust by its nature is built slowly.
* Building a really high-performing executive team at the highest level is a mirage,” says a famous management consultant who doesn’t want his name used because this particular  message is such a downer. “When such teams do exist, they’ll consist mostly of two people, maybe three.” It’s just too hard to build trust more extensively at the top level, where everyone is supposedly a star.
* Just as great individual performers possess highly developed mental models of their domains, the best teams are composed of members who share a mental model—of the domain, and of how the team will be effective.
* A product unlike any other can’t be commoditized. A service that reaches deep into the psyche of the buyer can never be purchased solely on price
* Creativity and innovation may even be the key to the future economic prosperity of America and other developed countries, at least according to one line of thinking. The theory, though somewhat radical, resonates with various trends. It’s radical because for three hundred years the source of economic dominance has clearly been leadership in science and technology; the countries or regions that were most advanced technologically have also been the most prosperous. But now a number of analysts, including Daniel H. Pink, author of A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future, and Virginia Postrel,  author of The Substance of Style: How the Rise of Aesthetic Value Is Remaking Commerce, Culture, and Consciousness, argue that this era may be ending. Technology will become commoditized by China and India, they say, being dispersed and adopted almost instantly after it’s created. Economic value will arise instead from the powers of the right brain—creativity, imagination, empathy, aesthetics.
* Great innovations are roses that bloom after long and careful cultivation.
* Hayes termed the long and absolutely typical preparatory period “ten years of silence,” which seemed to be required before anything worthwhile could be produced.
* The bigger picture is that the great innovators aren’t burdened by knowledge; they’re nourished by it. And they acquire it through a process we’ve seen before, involving many years of demanding deliberate practice activities
* innovations don’t get easier to develop if you distance yourself from the problem. Instead, “the aha moments grow out of hours of thought and study
* The idea of epiphany is a dreamer’s paradise where people want to believe that things are easier than they are.
* It’s often the same with innovation in organizations. Leaders exhort the troops to be innovative, but no one understands clearly what that means. Unsure where to go, they go nowhere
* What’s important is that people understand the organization’s priorities and thus know where innovation will do the most good.
* the temptation to continue doing what you do comfortably is too great.
* For decades the conventional view in medicine was that once we reach adulthood, we can only lose neurons, not add them, and our brain’s ability to adapt itself to new challenges, known as brain plasticity, shuts down. More recent research shows that none of this is true. Our brains are perfectly able to add new neurons well into old age when conditions demand it, and brain plasticity doesn’t stop with a
* Landing on your butt twenty thousand times is where great performance comes from
* Intrinsic motivation is still best, and extrinsic motivation that’s controlling is still detrimental to creativity, but extrinsic motivators that reinforce intrinsic drives can be highly effective.

The Joy of Game Theory: An Introduction to Strategic Thinking
*************************************************************

*Talwalkar, Presh*  (4294969598)

* We often do not have an infinite capacity to reason logically, only a bounded ability to reason rationality
* they were rewarded for not confusing theory with practice.
* Equal Division Of The Contested Sum
* 1. Determine which portion is contested or claimed by both parties.2. Split the contested portion equally.3. Assign the uncontested portion to the sole person claiming it.
* Focal points—choices that stand out and are attractive—are useful in coordination games because they help everyone make the same choice without communication
* A Nash equilibrium is a situation in which no person can improve his or her payout, given what others are doing. To put it another way, given the choices that everyone else is making, you are making the best possible choice that you can—the formal term, if you recall from Hotelling's game, is you are picking a best response.
* The advice might be slightly good for you, but it is often better for the adviser.
* When each person thinks about individual interest, the result is a Nash equilibrium that is worse for each in the group.
* any bilateral transaction could possibly degenerate into a Prisoner’s Dilemma if the parties do not trust each other.
* The general lesson is that you do not want to play the Prisoner's Dilemma.
* What you want to do is create a situation where others have to play it and you can profit
* The lesson is that even when you can communicate in a Prisoner's Dilemma, that still might not be enough as there is no way to enforce the agreement.
* You should be careful about trusting the other person in a Prisoner's Dilemma
* and the other person should be skeptical of your motives as well.
* if you aren't winning the game you are playing, consider changing the game.
* So in general, it is best to avoid playing games of chicken or change the game into something else.
* Threats can fall into two categories: credible and non-credible. A threat is credible if it will likely be followed through. For instance, when a utility company threatens to disconnect your service for non-payment, it is credible since it can and often does follow through.
* A threat is non-credible if the opposite holds: you cannot believe it since it is unlikely it will be followed through. These threats are made to encourage behavior, but a savvy person would not believe them. For instance, a defense attorney may threaten that her client will drag a matter out in court—no matter what the evidence is—to encourage the prosecution to consider out of court settlements. But the threat is not credible because if strong evidence comes out, the defense will most likely bargain.
* (1) you should only consider credible threats in your decision-making,
* (2) threats are credible only if you would follow through on them.
* Method 1: Have An Alternative
* Method 2: Use A “Risky Threat”
* Method 3: Suggest You Have Alternatives
* Method 4: Threaten To Go Public
* Method 5: Appear Crazy (At Your Own Risk)
* Thomas Schelling (of the “focal/Schelling points” fame) came up with the idea that appearing insane might be a strategic advantage
* A Nash equilibrium is based on your beliefs about other players, and how accurate those beliefs are. The subgame perfect equilibrium is the only Nash equilibrium where both players have infinite reasoning ability and they only care about money.
* The principle of embarrassment can be described as a strategic move that turns a simultaneous game
* into a sequential game
* we really get better results by limiting our options
* Negotiating is not always about what you can do but rather what others cannot do.
* One of the few credible ways to demonstrate what others cannot do is by withholding supply
* Contrary to popular opinion, working longer and harder is not always the best negotiating tactic.
* Withhold the supply; hold the power.
* Ayres, Ian and Nalebuff, Barry J., Common Knowledge As A Barrier To Negotiation (April 1997). Yale ICF Working Paper No. 97-01. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=36224 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.36224
* In game theory, when a player's action (like her yelling) leads to a worse outcome than another action (her hailing the other cab going by), for every possible way other players decide to act (in each situation, the chance I would give her the cab), the action is said to be dominated
* There is an obvious lesson from game theory: never choose a dominated action
* In fact, there are many times that burning a bridge is not just beneficial, but absolutely necessary to accomplish a goal.
* It is an extension of the strategy of limiting options.
* When Backed Into A Corner, Burn All Bridges Equally
* What results in sequential play is a mediocre outcome for both
* The used car market has developed protections to stop the market from unraveling. The main idea is to establish trust and improve a buyer's ability to recognize high-quality products. Tools such as car histories, warranties, and a national reputation (like CarMax) all improve a buyer's ability to judge quality. In game theory, an action or quality that can influence a belief is known as a signal.
* When you cannot get people to support your case, life can seem unfair
* Arrow's impossibility theorem
* whenever there are at least 2 people and at least 3 options, it is impossible to aggregate individual preferences without violating some desired conditions
* it makes just as much sense to limit loss as it does to seek profit.
* . If you're not winning the game you are playing, you must change the game and play by your own rules.

* Sexual excitement is difficult to hide, as often is guilt.
* Oral media (for example, telephone conversations and face-to-face meetings) are preferable to written media, such as notes and memos, when messages are ambiguous (requiring a great deal of assistance in interpreting them), but written media are preferable when messages are clear.
* smiling is universal, whereas many other nonverbal behaviors of body language (such as gestures or touch) differ between cultures and are therefore probably learnt.
* This sets up a virtuous cycle for the smiler and a vicious cycle for the non-smiler. Thus in sales, hospitality and negotiation situations, the person who smiles first increases the possibility of the other person(s) smiling, which increases trust and liking and, therefore, also cooperation and helpfulness. Smiling helps to bond people together.

* Time is viewed differently across the world. For some it is flexible, fluctuating and cyclical; while others see it as rigid, constant and linear
* Overall, some countries can be characterized as time-bound (Germany, UK, Switzerland and Scandinavia, for example), whereas others are time-blind (such as Spain, Portugal, Greece). Time-bound societies emphasize schedules, deadlines, time-wasting, time-keeping, a fast pace of life. Time-blind societies are more relaxed and casual about time. Hence what is considered to be late in one society is not necessarily so in another. As societies become more time-bound, they have a more competitive attitude to time, and so “fast” is better. Hence fast-living, fasteating, fast-tempo, manic-type work behavior emphasizing “catching up” and not being “left behind”. Time-bound societies see time as linear, and societies that are time-blind, see it as cyclical. Time-bound societies centre work around clocks, schedules, delivery dates, agendas, deadlines. Confusion between the two attitudes can make for serious misunderstandings at work.
* Collett (1994) points out various other time-related distinctions that relate to the world of work. The first is the time-blind culture’s ability to distinguish between “sacred” and “profane” time. The former is for eating, family and sleeping, while profane time is used for everything else. Hence, in Spain, meetings can easily be interrupted: the time is not dedicated solely to the meeting. There is also the distinction between monochronic and polychronic time. Time-bound societies are monochronic – people do one thing at a time, while time-blind societies are polychronic, happily ignoring appointments, schedules, deadlines and tolerating interruptions. There is also the issue of time-orientation: past, present and future. Thus the British are thought to be interested more in the distant and recent past, and therefore do not invest much in the future, whereas the Germans have a longer view of the future, investing in basic research, education and training.
* Gestures too do not travel
* euphemisms for lying: dissimulation, impression management, distortion.
* It is easier to forget than to distort the truth
* The autonomic nervous system changes with emotional arousal. Certain body changes occur – sweating, blushing, pupil dilation, breathing pattern, frequency of swallowing, all of which are difficult to inhibit
* There are essentially only two ways of lying: to conceal or to falsify
* As noted earlier, concealment is easier than falsification.
* There are two punishments for every lie: that for telling the lie and that for the lie failing.
* People with a strict, moral upbringing naturally tend to be the most guilt-prone.
* people forget that all behaviors have multiple causes and that there are few single, simple indicators
* The paradox is that authenticity and naturalness cannot easily be taught. Speeches have to be clear, simple and genuine, but that is often the problem. It takes a lot of “effort” to be natural
* Human beings are designed, it seems, to take in information via stories
* Affirmative gestures emphasize, stress and highlight the verbal message; they engage the audience, keep it focused and interested. Negative signs are those associated with tension, anxiety and nervousness; they are distractive, unnecessary and generally best avoided at any time.
* significance of the tie in creating an impression of power. It is, in fact, most noticed when wearers takes their ties off: their whole look suddenly becomes much more friendly and relaxed
* Physical objects of a large size located between the speaker and the audience demarcate the border between the listener and the talker.
* 1. Separate the people from the problems   People problems are the ones concerned with misperception and miscommunication. They stem from emotional charges and perception errors. They are psychological problems and thus need to be addressed correspondingly, and not by business concessions.
* Focus on interests, not positions
* Devise options for mutual gain
* Meetings frequently do, as the old adage has it, “take minutes and waste hours
* Memory is, however, fallible, flexible and fragile
* studies are fairly consistent on the point that we remember least of what we see, and more of what we read.
* impression management. Another word for this may be hypocrisy
* Office politicians (all unelected) “speak with forked tongue
* Intimacy is usually conveyed by the quality rather than the quantity of positive nonverbal signals
* It is not so much people’s demography that is important as their psychological needs
* What do all groups (cult and non-cult) and organizations offer to a potential recruit? The answer is friendship, identity, respect and security. Organizations also offer money, security and something to do. And they offer a world-view: a way of discerning right from wrong; good from bad. Hence all the talk of vision and mission, both of which are essentially cult words. These are powerful incentives for all people, whatever their background. They offer more: a structured lifestyle and the ability to acquire new skills. Through their (very different) ideologies, and products and processes, they also offer moral explanations of how the world works, what is important, and what is desirable.
* People who join extreme groups are not strange, disturbed, sheeplike idiots. We are all social animals and members of many groups. But the more secretive the group, the more we are likely to label it a cult. The more zealous the members, the more likely we are to call them deviants. And if they are involved in quasi-military activity, they are labelled terrorists
* It is also an acknowledged fact that the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior.
* The power of body language lies in its subtlety, in its promise of an action rather than the action itself
* Body language hints towards a certain disposition or behavior rather than identifies or determines it.

The Divine Proportion
*********************

*H. E. Huntley*  (4294967860)

* It is difficult to confine beauty to either objective or subjective categories. It seems to be more satisfactory to regard it as an interaction between the mind and an object or an idea which arouses emotion
* beauty arouses emotion.
* that quality or combination of qualities which affords keen pleasure to the senses, especially that of sight, or which charms the intellectual or moral faculties.
* emotions are regarded by psychologists as activities of the unconscious mind,
* aesthetic experience consists in the interaction between the universal primordial images buried in the unconscious and an external artifact or natural object which we call beautiful.
* A rectangle, the sides of which are in the golden ratio, is called the golden rectangle. Its shape appears to have aesthetic attractions superior to that of other rectangles
* The first point to note about the regular Platonic solids shown in figure 2.6 is that they are precisely five in number. A little thought shows that, while an infinite number of polygons may be drawn on a plane surface, it is not possible to construct more than five regular polyhedra in three-dimensional space. The surface of a regular polyhedron is bounded by congruent regular polygons. The simplest polygons that can form the surface are the equilateral triangle, the square and the pentagon. It is clear from figure 2.6 that we cannot form the corner of a polyhedron with fewer than three faces and that a corner may be formed by joining three, four, or five equilateral triangles. With six such triangles, the corner flattens into a plane. The same will happen if four squares are united. Similarly, three regular pentagons at a corner is a maximum. But hexagons, and polygons with more than five sides are all ruled out. This argument for the limitation to five regular solids is the source of Euler’s formula V + F = E + 2, where the letters stand for the number of vertices, faces, and edges respectively.
* Despite extravagant expenditure of time and skill, the result is nil.
* The mountain laboured and brought forth a mouse.”
* the delight that derives from beholding beauty.
* one of the secrets of effective poetry is its power to bring to the surface mind (i.e., the conscious mind) primordial images which are deeply buried constituents of the racial unconscious common to all mankind.
* A further quotation relating to the same example of beauty will serve to underline one of the important lessons of these chapters. For aesthetic appreciation there are two requirements: the first is given, the second acquired. The first is from nature—by inheritance; the second from nurture—by education.
* The hours when we are absorbed by beauty are the only hours when we really live.... These are the only hours that absorb the soul and fill it with beauty. This is real life, and all else is illusion, or mere endurance.
* Wordsworth said of poetry that it was “emotion recollected in tranquillity.”
* Here, I suggest, is the clue. Man is by nature a creator. After the likeness of his Maker, man is born to create: to fashion beauty, to originate new values. That is his supreme vocation. This truth awakens a resonant response deep within us, for we know that one of the most intense joys that the soul of man can experience is that of creative activity. Ask the artist. Ask the poet. Ask the scientist. Ask the inventor or my neighbor who grows prize roses. They all know the deep spiritual satisfaction associated with the moment of orgasm of creation.
* The act of creation and the act of appreciation of beauty are not, in essence, distinguishable.
* It is almost a truism to say that the pure mathematician is not interested in the truth of his statements, but only in their internal consistency.
* the
* When Coleridge tried to define beauty, he returned always to one deep thought; beauty, he said, is unity in variety
* Unconscious activity is only exceptionally recognized by the individual, despite the fact that unconscious motivation is one of the prime facts of life.
* There is one question on which mathematicians are sharply divided. It is the fundamental question as to what mathematics is. . . . I have maintained that mathematics is the language of physics. . . . Then what becomes of pure mathematics? . . . a language can be considered in at least two different ways, either in relation to the purpose which it serves as a medium for the expression of ideas or in relation to its internal structure. The study of linguistic relations as revealed in grammar, syntax, and in comparative philology is a vital and necessary element for the appreciation of any language. I venture to make the suggestion that pure mathematics is in fact the philological aspect of the language of physics.
* pure mathematics is in fact the philological aspect of the language of physics.
* the difficulty of accounting for a phenomenon does not invalidate its reality.
* As G. H. Hardy remarked, “It may be hard to define mathematical beauty, but that is true of beauty of any kind.”
* Keats in his “Ode on a Grecian Urn”:Beauty is truth, truth beauty, that is allYe know on earth, and all ye need to know.
* The truth of such a conclusion depends absolutely on the truth of the initial assumptions, provided that the logic of the argument is faultless
* Poetry is not the thing said, but a way of saying it.
* Poetry means the distant echo of the primitive world behind our veil of words,”
* As the conscious mind expresses itself in language and gesture, so the unconscious mind may become articulate in music and in mathematics
* Now we have reached the nucleus of the argument. The ultimate source of aesthetic sensibility to the various manifestations of beauty in mathematics is to be sought for in the unconscious mind or even (frequently) in the collective unconscious by virtue of which man is the heir of all the ages. The mental processes evoked in all men for a million years past by their physical environment have deposited a soil in which the roots of the psyche are deeply and securely implanted. Experiences of all the generations of a man’s ancestors, repeated millions of times and recorded as memory structures in the brain, are scored ever more deeply as they are transmitted from generation to generation through the centuries, often showing a brief vitality in unaccountable dreams. The mind of a newly born baby is no tabula rasa: before he has had the opportunity to develop a conscious mind he is equipped with these inherited memory structures. For example, one of his earliest mental activities impels him to seek his mother’s breast.
* music is pre-eminently the language of the unconscious mind: in music the unconscious becomes articulate.
* But now the obvious question arises: why does the symbolic evocation of the memory of familiar racial experiences produced by music arouse a feeling of satisfaction which is an ingredient of aesthetic appreciation? The answer seems to be that it is precisely because these experiences are familiar. We are made to feel “at home.” We enjoy a sense of security among things that we know and understand. The unfamiliar is unsettling. But any form of art, or poetry or music or mathematics, which runs smoothly and swiftly along well-worn memory grooves puts the mind at peace in a well-remembered environment. Ignore these age-old tracks and the aesthetic experience is impossible. Effective art depends upon primordial images.
* INGREDIENTS OF BEAUTY
* The alternation of tension and relief
* The realization of expectatio
* “Brevity is the soul of wit.” It may be the soul of beauty too. An example from poetry could be the brevity of the metre of Francis Thompson’s “To a Snowflake”:
* “Unity in variety” was Coleridge’s definition of beauty (Chap. I). It is frequently exemplified in music. As an example of the artistic quality of a mathematical theorem, consider the discovery by Johann Bernoulli (1667–1748) of the beautiful curve called the Brachistochrone (Fig. 6.5).
* Surprise at the unexpected
* The perception of unsuspected relationships
* The smoothness of their contours is associated with the ease and comfort of the eye’s muscular effort
* The curves that the human gaze has followed for a million years include the sea horizon, the skyline of the rolling downs, the rainbow, the meteor track, the parabola of the waterfall, the sling-stone and the arrow, the arcs traced in the sky by the sun and the crescent moon, the flight of a bird, and many others.
* A sense of wonder, even of awe, in the presence of the infinite, is one of the basic human emotions
* “Having eyes, they see not.
* This example affords an opportunity to remind the reader of a matter discussed briefly in chapter I. No one who has had experience of it can doubt the reality of the joy of creative activity, or of making an original discovery, however trifling. This does not necessarily involve revealing new knowledge but of finding for oneself something fresh, even though it had been known for a thousand years. Very few, if any, young students of mathematics, are entirely without this happy experience, and some have regarded this as one of the main ends of the education of man—“his vocation is to be a creator” (see p. 21).

Battle for God
**************

*Armstrong, Karen*  (4294968654)

* Rational thought has achieved astonishing success in the practical sphere, but it cannot assuage our sorrow
* s young I thought there was some order governing you and your deeds.” But nowyou seem to be a labyrinth of errors, a frightful desert, a den of wild beasts, a game in which men move in circles … a stony field, a meadow full of serpents, a flowering but barren orchard, a spring of cares, a river of tears, a sea of suffering, a vain hope.
* The attempt to force people to accept the prevailing ideology against their will or before they are ready for it often results in ideas and practices which, in the eyes of the persecuting authorities themselves, are highly undesirable
* Prado and Da Costa were both precursors of the modern spirit. Their stories show that the mythos of confessional religion is unsustainable without the spiritual exercises of prayer and ritual, which cultivate the more intuitive parts of the mind. Reason alone can produce only an attenuated deism, which is soon abandoned because it brings us no help when we are faced with sorrow or are in trouble. Prado and Da Costa lost their faith because they were deprived of the opportunity to practice it, but another Marrano Jew from Amsterdam showed that the exercise of reason could become so absorbing and exhilarating in itself that the need for myth receded. This world becomes the sole object of contemplation, and human beings, not God, become the measure of all things. The exercise of reason can itself, in a man or woman of exceptional intellect, lead to some kind of mystical illumination. This has also been part of the modern experience.
* Reason alone can produce only an attenuated deism, which is soon abandoned because it brings us no help when we are faced with sorrow or are in trouble
* Today, conservative society is in trouble. Either it has been effectively taken over by the modern Western ethos, or it is undergoing the difficult transition from the conservative to the modern spirit
* e the “conservative” bent of premodern society did not spring from any fundamental timidity but represented a realistic appraisal of the limitations of this type of culture
* In a conservative society, social stability and order were considered more important than freedom of expression.
* But after such a catastrophe, the natural conservatism of premodern society was likely to become more pronounced. People concentrated on recovering slowly and painfully what had been lost rather than on striking out for something new. In Sunni Islam, for example—the version of the faith practiced by most Muslims and the established religion of the Ottoman empire—it was agreed that “the gates of ijtihad (“independent reasoning”) had closed.3 Hitherto, Muslim jurists had been allowed to exercise their own judgment in order to resolve questions that arose in relation to theology and law for which neither the Koran nor established tradition had an explicit answer. But by the early modern period, in an attempt to conserve a tradition that had almost been destroyed, Sunni Muslims believed that there was no need for further independent thought. The answers were all in place; the Shariah was a fixed blueprint for society, and ijtihad was neither necessary nor desirable. Instead, Muslims must imitate (taqlid) the past. Instead of seeking new solutions, they should submit to the rulings found in the established legal manuals. Innovation (bidah) in matters of law and practice was considered as disruptive and dangerous in Sunni Islamdom during the early modern period as was heresy in doctrinal matters in the Christian West.

Innovation (bidah) in matters of law and practice was considered as disruptive and dangerous in Sunni Islamdom during the early modern period as was heresy in doctrinal matters in the Christian West.
* The Koran also expressed this conservative ethos. It insists repeatedly that it is not bringing a new truth to humanity, but revealing the essential laws of human life. It is a “reminder” of truths known already.
* In true conservative style, Muslims were conforming their behavior to a past perfection.
* None of the esoterics wanted to be “original” in our sense; all were original in the conservative way of returning to fundamentals, which alone, it was thought, could lead to human perfection and fulfillment.1
* Like any esoteric spirituality, Shiism at this date was only for an elite. It tended to attract the more intellectually adventurous Muslims, who had a talent and a need for mystical contemplation
* Even though the Shiah had become a mythological faith, that did not mean that it was irrational. In fact, Shiism became a more rational and intellectual version of Islam than the Sunnah. Shiis found that they were in agreement with the Sunni theologians known as the Mutazilites, who tried to rationalize the doctrines of the Koran. In their turn, the Mutazilites gravitated toward the Shiah. Paradoxically, the a-rational doctrine of the Occultation allowed the Shii ulema more freedom to exercise their rational powers in the pragmatic world of affairs than the Sunni ulema. Because the Hidden Imam was no longer available, they had to rely on their own intellectual powers. In the Shiah, therefore, the “gates of ijtihad” were never declared closed, as in the Sunnah.35 At first, it is true, Shiis did feel mentally hobbled when their Imam vanished, but by the thirteenth century, an eminent and learned Shii cleric was known precisely as a mujtahid, one who was deemed capable of the rational activity of ijtihad.
* But power corrupts.
* But, as we have seen, coercion in religious matters is usually counterproductive
* e modernizing process can induce great anxiety
* Yet they were also men of their time, and this was a time of transition. Throughout this book, we shall see that the modernizing process can induce great anxiety. As their world changes, people feel disoriented and lost. Living in medias res, they cannot see the direction that their society is taking, but experience its slow transformation in incoherent ways. As the old mythology that gave structure and significance to their lives crumbles under the impact of change, they can experience a numbing loss of identity and a paralyzing despair. The most common emotions, as we shall see, are helplessness and a fear of annihilation that can, in extreme circumstances, erupt in violence. We see something of this in Luther. During his early life, he was prey to agonizing depressions. None of the medieval rites and practices of the faith could touch what he called the tristitia (“sorrow”) that made him terrified of death, which he imagined as total extinction. When this black horror descended upon him, he could not bear to read Psalm 90, which describes the evanescence of human life and portrays men being condemned by the anger and fury of God. Throughout his career, Luther saw death as an expression of God’s wrath. His theology of justification by faith depicted human beings as utterly incapable of contributing to their own salvation and wholly reliant on the benevolence of God. It was only by realizing their powerlessness that they could be saved. To escape his depressions, Luther plunged into a frenzy of activity, determined to do what good he could in the world, but consumed also by hatred.4 Luther’s rage against the Pope, the Turks, Jews, women, and rebellious peasants—not to mention every single one of his theological opponents—would be typical of other reformers in our own day, who have struggled with the pain of the new world and who have also evolved a religion in which the love of God is often balanced by a hatred of other human beings.

* In pushing reason out of the religious sphere, Luther was one of the first Europeans to secularize it.6
* Yet again, the secularization of politics began as a new way of being religious.
* Newton became almost obsessed with the desire to purge Christianity of its mythical doctrines. He became convinced that the a-rational dogmas of the Trinity and the Incarnation were the result of conspiracy, forgery, and chicanery. While working on his great book Philosophiae Naturalis Principia (1687), Newton began work on a bizarre treatise entitled The Philosophical Origins of Gentile Theology, which argued that Noah had founded a superstition-free religion in which there were no revealed scriptures, no mysteries, but only a Deity which could be known through the rational contemplation of the natural world. Later generations had corrupted this pure faith; the spurious doctrines of the Incarnation and the Trinity had been added to the creed by unscrupulous theologians in the fourth century. Indeed, the Book of Revelation had prophesied the rise of Trinitarianism—“this strange religion of ye West,” “the cult of three equal Gods”—as the abomination of desolation.14 Newton was still a religious man and still, to an extent, in thrall to the conservative spirit in his quest for a rational primordial religion. But he could not express his faith in the same way as previous generations. He was unable to appreciate that the doctrine of the Trinity had been devised by the Greek Orthodox theologians of the fourth century precisely as mythos, similar to that later created by the Jewish Kabbalists. As Gregory of Nyssa had explained, the three hypostases of Father, Son, and Spirit were not objective facts but simply “terms that we use” to express the way in which the “unnameable and unspeakable” divine nature (ousia) adapts itself to the limitations of our human minds.15 It made no sense outside the cultic context of prayer, contemplation, and liturgy. But Newton could only see the Trinity in rational terms, had no understanding of the role of myth, and was therefore obliged to jettison the doctrine. The difficulty that many Western Christians today experience with trinitarian theology shows that they share Newton’s bias in favor of reason. Newton’s position was entirely understandable. He was one of the very first people in the West to master fully the methods and disciplines of scientific rationalism. His was a towering achievement and the result was as intoxicating as any religious experience. He used to cry out in the course of his studies: “O God, I think Thy thoughts after Thee!”16 He had literally no time for the intuitive mystical consciousness, which might actually have impeded his progress. Reason and myth were, for the first time in human history, becoming incompatible because of the intensity and dazzling success of this Western experiment.

* Truth was never absolute, since new discoveries could always replace the old; it had to be demonstrated objectively, and measured by its effectiveness in the practical world.
* Reason and logos were improving the lot of men and women in the modern world in a myriad practical ways, but they were not competent to deal with those ultimate questions that human beings seem forced
* As so often, modernity took with one hand what it gave with the other
* Reason was enlightening and emancipating, but it could also estrange men and women from the world they were learning to control so effectively.
* Mysticism was not for the masses. At its best, it was a one-to-one process, in which the adept was carefully supervised to make sure that he or she did not fall into unhealthy psychic states.
* It was at this time that Pope’s Day (November 5) became an annual holiday, during which rowdy crowds burned effigies of the Ponti
* theology of rage would frequently be evolved in response to dawning modernity
* religion often provides the means that get people through the painful rite of passage to modernity.
* War of Independence had become part of God’s providential design for the destruction of the Papal Antichrist, which would surely herald the arrival of God’s millennial Kingdom in America.5
* It was a paradox in early-nineteenth-century America, as in late-twentieth-century fundamentalist movements, that a desire for independence, autonomy, and equality should lead large numbers of people to obey religious demagogues implicitly
* The prophetic rebellion of these American prophets was both successful and enduring in the United States, and this means that we should not expect modern fundamentalist movements in societies that are currently modernizing to be ephemeral and a passing “madness.”
* Hegel’s pupil Ludwig Feuerbach (1804–72) argued, religion was bringing about “the disuniting of man from himself.… God is perfect, man imperfect; God eternal, man temporal; God almighty, man weak
* For Karl Marx (1818–83), religion was a symptom of a sick society, an opiate that made the diseased social system bearable and removed the will to find a cure by directing attention away from this world to the next.
* Reason no longer had to submit to a higher court. It was not to be restricted by morality but must be pushed to the end “without regard to any other consideration
* By making “God” a wholly notional truth, struggling to reach the divine by intellect alone, as some modern believers had attempted to do, modern men and women had killed it for themselves.

The Everything Negotiating Book
*******************************

*Margaret Kaeter*  (4294969520)

* concessions are privileges—tiny pieces of gold that need to be rationed wisely.
* you want to negotiate with the person who has the authority to make and accept concessions.
* a loaded question, you will find that it is actually more like a judgment wrapped up in a pretty little package topped off with a carefully tied question mark.
* A leading question is the kind of question that tries to get a specific response, usually to prove the asker’s point.
* A well-balanced discussion involves an equal amount of talking and listening among all parties
* Some people use talking as a way to compensate for what they lack in leverage or offers. The less they have going for them, the more they feel the need to talk in order to make it appear that the opposite is true.
* A Shouting Match
* Whichever character they get into, their purpose is to tap into your emotions and control the way you think.
* Abuse comes in many varieties—none of which should ever be tolerated. The intention of the abuser is to wreak havoc on your ego in order to achieve his own goals. Abusers use personal attacks to insult your intelligence. Verbal abuse—in the form of name-calling, foul language, emotional exploitation, manipulation, and cruelty—is intended to shake your self-confidence and well-being.
* Our individual experiences influence how we see the rest of world and how we react to what we encounter.
* “I” vs. “you”—Instead of saying, “You still didn’t answer my question,” rephrase the statement: “I’m sorry, I still don’t understand. I think a few examples can give me a better idea.” By placing
* Negative vs. positive—Words like can’t, won’t, shouldn’t, and don’t should be used sparingly. Instead of saying, “I can’t do that” try “I have a few other options I’d like to get your opinion on.”
* “But”—Think of this word as a cutoff point, beyond which your counterpart will stop listening to what you’re saying. He
* Unforgiving negotiators know that the best way to throw other people off course is to tamper with their inner strengths and expose their weaknesses
* Your first line of defense against this tactic is to know your hot buttons:
* If you retaliate with anger, the other party knows she has you right where she wants you: on her territory. Her hardball tactics succeeded in putting you on her level, and now she can use it against you every step of the way. Suddenly, she accuses you of being hard to work with, temperamental, and stubborn
* When it’s your turn to give up concessions, one of the biggest mistakes you’re liable to make is thinking that the other party values what you’re offering as much (or as little) as you do
* One more thing to remember about making concessions is that you should always ask for something in return
* If you haven’t been keeping track of concessions, you’ll fail to see how much you’ve given away compared to how much you’ve received.
* Whenever you’re feeling overwhelmed, anxious, angry, or fed up, simply think about your aspirations, and draw your energy from there.
* Remaining goal-oriented also involves memorizing the other party’s goals in addition to keeping your own in the forefront
* Unrealistic First OfferOne way to get a “feel” for how much (or how little) the other party is willing to give you is by giving an unrealistic first offer. The other party’s reaction to this offer can prove to be very useful. First, based on their expression—anger, dissatisfaction, surprise, composure, or eagerness—you can get an idea about what number is either acceptable to them or within the scope of what they’re willing to negotiate. Second, the more unrealistic your first offer, the more room you have to negotiate the offer that you’re really willing to settle on.
* Another way to counter the other party’s unrealistic offer is to ignore it completely. Start talking about something else to tactfully deliver the message that you’re not happy with the offer
* Typically (and this is what the other party is betting on), we’re more apt to agree to compromise when we’re experiencing time restraints.
* To test if your assumption is accurate, ask your counterpart a series of questions
* Why is this deadline necessary
* "Is this deadline the best option
* What are the consequences if I don’t accept this deadline
* Just like anything else, deadlines are negotiable. They should not be used as a means of pressuring you to make decisions in haste
* There’s no easy way to deliver a deadline without causing the other party to be a little miffed. No matter how gently you approach the subject, she’s going to get upset because you’re putting her in a compromising position
* Most concessions are made toward the end of a negotiation’s deadline, if there is one
* Because it’s awkward to make your body go against its own grain, these skills must be learned and developed over time in order to execute them with the level of sophistication needed to make the act seem effortless
* The best way to tell if someone is bluffing during a negotiation is to ask questions
* Music is the silence between the notes.
* Your goal is to walk into the negotiation as if you couldn’t possibly fail
* The one good thing about deadlock is that it’s not always permanent. There are ways to get around it if you stay calm and allow your mind to be open to a variety of different possibilities.
* Some negotiators handle closing with a completely different mindset and a totally different approach, so give them the courtesy of preparing themselves for it instead of unexpectedly springing it on them.
* Take a break and go over everything with a colleague or friend. Review your goals and ask yourself if they’ve been met; seek positive reinforcement in the objectives you completed. Continue to survey the facts and if you feel good about them, it’s safe to assume your reluctance is originating from the grips of fear.
* It’s okay to feel apprehensive, but take control of it before it ruins what you’ve worked so hard to achieve.
* A little enthusiasm goes a long way, especially when your counterpart shows hesitation. Just a few encouraging words may be just what she needs to hear to move on. You can also point out all the objectives the other party has accomplished. Sometimes hearing them listed out loud makes a bigger impact than just quietly thinking them over.
* Don’t try to rehash issues you’ve already agreed on—you could be opening up a can of worms. At this point in the game, you want to reassure, review, and revise if necessary, but you definitely don’t want to renegotiate.

Who Gets Promoted, Who Doesn't, and Why: 10 Things You'd Better Do if You Want to Get Ahead
*******************************************************************************************

*Donald Asher*  (4294967867)

* , do you want to manage your career or just experience it?
* cost and risk are not the same thing. Costs are estimable, finite, and numeric; they’re not scary. Risks are, by definition, scary, unknown, and unpredictabl
* Suppose you have no fatal flaws, you’ve anticipated and acquired the needed skillset, and you are a well-regarded standout among your peers. So how could you be passed over for promotion? Simple: You may be the best person for the job, but you may not be available to take the job! Whether a promotion involves filling a new position or replacing an existing one, the organization is going to want that job filled on a specific schedule. There may be some flexibility, but if you cannot be extracted from your current duties to achieve a smooth handoff within the window of opportunity, someone else will be getting the new assignment.
* There are plenty of employees who make great soldiers implementing someone else’s plans. But the people who advance quickly bring ideas and can create plans. So when you approach a boss about a problem, offer yourself as the solution to that problem.
* To be a fast-track person you need to make yourself easily replaceable. To accomplish this you will need to:
* Periodic heroics are even better than daily reliability because they get you noticed.
* If you overpromise and underdeliver, you’re not going to look like much of a hot dog.
* Talent sharpens talent.
* How you treat the people who have no power over you reveals your true character.
* One of the main contentions of this book is that managing your career is not the same thing as doing your job. You can be great at doing your job but be simultaneously neglecting or even destroying yo
* If you mimic the speech of the people with power, you will be closer to having that power yourself.
* Verbum sat sapienti est.
* Few of us are born or educated into our fashion sense. We absorb it, like a sponge. And a sponge in dirty water absorbs a lot of impurities
* Don’t just have relationships, but manage your relationships
* learn how to say no. Have a can-do attitude, but don’t be a yes man. When something’s not a winner, you have to learn to say, without whining, “No, I don’t want to do that. That’s not a good idea,” or “That’s not possible.”
* All of business is sales. If you don’t think you are in sales, you are simply mistaken. Accountants are in sales. Engineers are in sales. If you’re not selling your company, you’re selling yourself. If you’re not selling yourself, you’re selling your ideas. If you are on a team, the team will take direction from the person who best sells her ideas to the others. If you are being observed by senior management for promotion, it is not the best performer who is promoted but the performer who is perceived to be the best. Your ability to sell your skills and your potential determines how you are perceived and creates your long-term career success.
* What goes into being a salesperson? Six things really matter:AttitudeThe ability to think like someone elseThe ability to prepare for a meetingPersistenceThe ability to overcome objections to ge
* So before you attempt to influence someone, spend some time looking at the world from their point of view. Try on their mindset. Understand where they’re coming from. How will your suggestion impact their world? You better know that first, before you structure your appeal to them.
* Try arguing the other side of any position you hold dear. It will help you become more creative with your message
* If you want to change the rules where you work, there’s an old saying that comes into play: If you want to change the rules of the game, you have to win the game first.
* This is the area I was most involved with her. She ran a low-level job search outside her firm, more or less constantly. She interviewed for positions, she talked to headhunters, she had a disguised resume on most of the main boards, she took a lot of lunches with pals from other banks, she went to conventions—she did it all. This empowered her with the knowledge that she could change jobs anytime she wanted, which allowed her to be confident and speak the truth, which allowed her to stand out in this risk-averse crowd of bankers. Do you see how it worked?
* Think of your department as a family. You might fight bitterly within your family, but to the world, you present a united front. It works the same way in an organization. If someone outside criticizes anyone in your immediate family, you would rise to defend them. Likewise you should defend and promote your boss, even if you have “issues” with her.
* Do Not Be the Source of Surprises
* Give Your Boss the Information That Matters
* In the executive suite, being a source of surprises is almost always a bad thing, even if the surprise is positive. For example, suppose you have more revenue than expected, the response at the top is going to be: You should have had more accurate projections.
* Having a nonstellar but predictable track record can, in fact, be much better than having a reputation for occasional but unpredictable brilliance.
* Bring Solutions When You Bring Problems
* How to Deliver CriticismThe first rule of delivering criticism is to criticize only to change future outcomes
* Criticism is most palatable when it is sandwiched between praise, using this pattern: POSITIVE, sneak-in-a-negative, POSITIVE. If you are careful, with this technique you can criticize upstairs and sideways, as well as down the org chart
* actively look for high performers in the organization. Attach yourself to their projects, and see if you can get them involved in your projects. Find ways to collaborate with them. Get associated with
* In any organization, the force of the status quo is so powerful it’s like the physical law of inertia. An object at rest tends to stay at rest. An object moving in a certain direction will continue in that direction and will not veer without an outside force acting upon it. An object moving at a certain speed will maintain that speed, neither speeding up nor slowing down on its own. A lot of people in any organization are like objects in space, being controlled by the law of inertia.
* Having a benefactor starts with your boss. When your boss has your back, you get the benefit of the doubt from people up and down the food chain. Having the full faith and credit of your boss is a great foundation for your reputation. But the real trump card is to have real friends two and three clicks, or more, up the org chart.
* However, knowing someone distantly up the chain of command may not serve your needs. Calling them in to sort out some small matter on your level will be seen as a waste of their time. Having friends at the top, when you’re near the bottom, is like having a nuclear bomb—sure, you have it, but you can’t really use it. A really big gun should be brought in only in the most dire of circumstances. Otherwise the benefit of angels and benefactors comes from access to information, advice, and counsel.
* A really big gun should be brought in only in the most dire of circumstances.
* Because it is neither good to be feared nor beloved, the best management style is to be well liked.
* One huge rule about business friends, however, is this: You have to make friends before you need them. When you make friends only because of what they can do for you, you become known as a user. You have to be a friend to have a friend. You have to be useful, entertaining, charming, and supportive to have friends who are useful, entertaining, charming, and supportive.
* This is akin to the rule of all politics: Doing favors for people is like money in the bank. You can call it in when you need it, but you have to do the favors first.
* Being rigid is a career stopper, and being flexible is a career asset. B
* Luck is an odd force in the world. Luck is not random. Luck can be prepared for. It can be pushed a little. If the soil in one place is not right, move your seeds. If it doesn’t rain this year, eat from your stores and prepare for next year. Almost all agrarian societies have some kind of rain dance, or rain ceremony, because they believe luck can be lobbied. The best way to lobby luck is to be ready for its arrival.
* Anyone who is not looking two positions ahead is not looking far enough. For a fast-track careerist, that’s somewhere between two and five years. So
* You need to learn to develop contingency plans for your plans and to model multiple scenarios with more variables in play. You need to learn to pay attention to those with power and potential. If you unexpectedly gain access to people with great power or great potential, quickly develop a plan to capitalize on that contact. Learn to consider options that you had not anticipated. That’s the biggest key of all.

The Wisdom of Psychopaths
*************************

*Kevin Dutton*  (4294967914)

* There was never a genius without a tincture of madness.
* When you go down the road of disorders conferring advantages, of clouds, silver linings, and psychological consolation prizes, it’s difficult to conceive of a condition that doesn’t pay off—at least in some form or another. Obsessive-compulsive? You’re never going to leave the gas on. Paranoid? You’ll never fall afoul of the small print. In fact, fear and sadness—anxiety and depression—constitute two of the five basic emotions1 that are found universally across cultures, and that, as such, virtually all of us experience at some point in our lives. But there’s one group of people who are the exception to the rule, who don’t experience either—even under the most difficult and trying of circumstances. Psychopaths. A psychopath wouldn’t worry even if he had left the gas on.2 Any silver linings there?
* Don’t get too cocky. No matter how good you are. Don’t let them see you coming,
* t’s the gaff, my friend—make yourself small. Be the hick. The cripple. The nerd. The leper. The freak. Look at me—I’ve been underestimated from day one.” Pacino was playing the Devil.
* Language, for psychopaths, is only word deep.
* Intellectual ability on its own is just an elegant way of finishing second,”
* Other studies seem to confirm the “mixing desk” picture: the borderline between functional and dysfunctional psychopathy depends not on the presence of psychopathic attributes per se, but rather on their levels and the way they’re combined. Mehmet Mahmut and his colleagues at Macquarie University have recently shown that patterns of brain dysfunction (specifically, in relation to the orbital frontal cortex, the area of the brain that regulates the input of the emotions in decision making) observed in both criminal and noncriminal psychopaths exhibit dimensional rather than discrete differences. This, he suggests, means that the two groups should not be viewed as qualitatively distinct populations, but rather as occupying different positions on the same neuropsychological continuum.
* And yet the core, underlying thesis that psychopaths are in possession of wisdom is a serious one. Not, perhaps, wisdom in the traditional sense of that word: as an emergent property of advancing years and cumulative life experience. But as an innate, ineffable function of their being.
* We’ll consider, in depth, the advantages of being a psychopath—or rather, in some situations at least, having those dials turned up a little higher than normal. We’ll look at the fearlessness. The ruthlessness. The “presence” (psychopaths tend to blink just a little bit less than the rest of us, a physiological aberration that often helps give them their unnerving, hypnotic air).2 Devastating, dazzling, and super-confident are the epithets that one often hears about them. Not, as one might expect, from themselves. But from their victims! The irony is plain as day. Psychopaths appear, through some Darwinian practical joke, to possess the very personality characteristics that many of us would die for. Indeed, that many have died for—the reason, of course, why our old friend Fabrizio Rossi had trouble believing that anything good could possibly come out of the crawl space.
* Silver bullet” questions, which through some fiendish sleight of mind can somehow reveal our true psychological colors, just don’t exist in the real world.
* an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the culture of the individual who exhibits it.”
* The psychopath, he observes, is an intelligent person, characterized by a poverty of emotions, the absence of a sense of shame, egocentricity, superficial charm, lack of guilt, lack of anxiety, immunity to punishment, unpredictability, irresponsibility, manipulativeness, and a transient interpersonal lifestyle
* The combination of low risk aversion and lack of guilt or remorse, the two central pillars of psychopathy,”
* Yet alongside the challenge to our existential comfort zones, these two accounts also conceal, deep within the lining of their tragedies, a rather odd paradox. The fact that conformity is built into our brains is about as nailed down an evolutionary certainty as you can get. When a herd animal is threatened by a predator, what does it do? It huddles closer to the group. As individual salience decreases, chances of survival increase. This is just as true in humans as it is in other species. Streaming behind our supersonic, turbocharged brains are ancient Darwinian vapor trails stretching all the way back to the brutal, blood-soaked killing fields of prehistory. In an experiment, for instance, that hitched the latest in social networking to its earliest biological origins, social psychologist Vladas Griskevicius, then at Arizona State University, and his coworkers found that when users of an Internet chat room are made to feel under threat, they show signs of “sticking together.” Their views display convergence, and they become more likely to conform to the attitudes and opinions of others in the forum.
* Sometimes, when you’re in a hostile situation, your best option is to match the aggressive intentions of a potentially violent individual. And then go one step beyond them. Raise them, in other words, to use a poker analogy. Only then, once you’ve gained the psychological ascendancy, shown them … hinted … who’s boss, can you begin to talk them down.
* Conflict, it transpires, isn’t the only means of establishing dominance in the natural world
* Pure unconditional aggression and pure unconditional capitulation are destined to fail as strategies of social exchange in a society of multiple interaction and mutual dependence.
* as strategies for survival, neither unqualified cooperation nor unqualified competition may be regarded as evolutionarily stable
* altruism, though undoubtedly an ingredient of basic group cohesion, is perfectly capable of arising not out of some higher-order differential such as the good of the species or even the good of the tribe, but out of a survival differential existing purely between individuals.
* Just because I don’t care doesn’t mean I don’t understand.
* men with a specific triumvirate of personality traits—the stratospheric self-esteem of narcissism; the fearlessness, ruthlessness, impulsivity, and thrill-seeking of psychopathy; and the deceitfulness and exploitativeness of Machiavellianism—can actually do pretty well for themselves out there in certain echelons of society.
* But logic, as the political activist Gloria Steinem once remarked, is often in the eye of the logician.
* Only it’s an intoxication that sharpens, rather than dulls, the senses; an altered state of consciousness that feeds on precision and clarity, rather than fuzziness and incoherence …
* The great epochs of our lives are the occasions when we gain the courage to rebaptize our evil qualities as our best qualities.
* Imagining, it would seem, really does make it so. Whenever we read a story, our level of engagement with it is such that we “mentally simulate each new situation encountered in a narrative,” according to lead researcher Nicole Speer. Our brains then interweave these newly encountered situations with knowledge and experience gleaned from our own lives, to create an organic mosaic of dynamic mental syntheses.
* To what extent has his free will been eroded by his genetic predisposition?”
* It’s the right kind of wrong,
* Sentiment is a chemical aberration found on the losing side.
* But what’s worse, from a moral perspective? Beating someone up who deserves it? Or beating yourself up, who doesn’t?
* The problem with a lot of people is that what they think is a virtue is actually a vice in disguise. It’s much easier to convince yourself that you’re reasonable and civilized than soft and weak, isn’t it?”
* Good men sleep peacefully in their beds at night,” George Orwell once pointed out, “because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf.”
* people spend so much time worrying about what might happen, what might go wrong, that they completely lose sight of the present.
* you cannot allow any members of your brain’s emotional executive committee to knock on the door of the decision-making boardroom, let alone take a seat at the table.
* Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming “Wow! What a Ride!”
* you can meet with Triumph and DisasterAnd treat those two impostors just the same …”
* In moments of flow, the past and the future evaporate as abstractions. All that remains is an intense, uncanny, attention-devouring present, an overwhelming feeling of being “in the zone.” This is the union, the enchanted consummation, of mind, body, and game: what’s known in the trade as the “Golden Triangle” of performance, a trance-like state of effortless action and reaction, where time and self converge—and one is in control, but not in control, at the same time.
* When the stakes are high and backs are against the wall, it’s a psychopath you want alongside you. But if there’s nothing to play for and you’re on an even keel, forget it
* When Dickens decided to send Scrooge the ghosts of the past, present, and future, he chose the three specters that haunt all of us. But anchor your thoughts entirely in the present, screen out the chatter of the querulous, recriminative past and the elusive, importunate future, and a
* altered state of consciousness that feeds on precision and clarity”
* “One must focus purely on the now. When one enters a state like that, one is able to smell time. To feel its waves washing over one’s senses. The tiniest ripple may be detected over great distances. And the signal intercepted. Often it appears that the two combatants move simultaneously. But this is not so. It is not difficult. With practice it can be mastered.”

* What you consider risky, after all, depends somewhat on the circumstances of your life and lifestyle. People who don’t have enough to eat don’t worry about apples contaminated with Alar. People who face daily violence at their front door don’t worry about hijackings on flights to the Bahamas
* imminent risks strike much more fear in our hearts than distant ones; it’s much harder to get a teenager than an older person to take long-term dangers like smoking seriously.
* People will risk a lot to prevent a loss, in other words, but risk very little for possible gain
* A risk that you assume by actually doing something seems far more risky than a risk you take by not doing something, even though the risk of doing nothing may be greater.

* It is impossible to trap modern physics into predicting anything with perfect determinism because it deals with probabilities from the outset
* And that’s what science is ultimately all about: how and why, not where and when.
* Prediction, said physicist Frank Oppenheimer,\* “is dependent only on the assumption that observed patterns will be repeated. The merchant, the politician, the parent, the artist, and the doctor all depend for their success on the subtleties of pattern recognition....

Puritan Islam
*************

*Vann, Barry A.*  (4294969391)

* Within the Sunni realm, there are four schools of jurisprudence: Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki, and Shafii
* Hanbali is the most literal of the four traditions. As an outgrowth of this literal tradition, conservative Wahhabism gained traction in the eighteenth century.
* Puritan Islam has no tolerance for “taking the middle ground” on matters of religion.
* The Asad family that rules Syria adheres to the Alawite expression of Shia Islam.
* In the final analysis of the forces behind migration, economics is the bait that pulls people across international boundaries
* In Hamtramck, Muslim influence in local politics is already overshadowing voices coming from long-established Christian communities. Since 2004, the city has permitted calls to prayer to be broadcast via loudspeakers across public spaces five times per day.
* A large and looming problem with this situation is that few people will take action to bring about social change in their home countries to reduce the underlying problems of high fertility and few economic niches to accommodate large numbers of people
* In recent years, Westerners have been taught to see all cultures as equals, and many Westerners now see their own cultures as flawed and oppressive to people living in less fortunate places
* The belief that God guides those whom he pleases is similar to the predestination doctrine associated with Calvinism. Max Weber, the twentieth-century German sociologist who associated Calvinism with the rise of capitalism, argued that the doctrine of predestination creates a psychological crisis among believers because it causes them to ask the question: Am I of the elect?10 Because Muslims have no real way of knowing if they are living in accordance with Allah's will, they seek assurance of their atonement, and in so doing, they create a situation in which they can demonstrate true faithfulness.11
* A Muslim had better believe what is commanded of him by the Prophet because submission requires visible actions as well as internal convictions
* This notion is quite the opposite of Calvinism, which argues that salvation is an unconditional decision made by God
* Some Arminians, on the other hand, believe that God predetermined who he has chosen for eternal redemption, but his elections were made based on his foreknowledge of those who will choose him. In fact, sixteenth century Dutch reformer Jacobus Arminius, after whom the Arminians are named, argued that people can choose to reject God's offer of salvation.
* Grace, many Protestants have argued, literally means an unmerited free gift of salvation.
* Perhaps the most powerful and unifying concept in Islam's community is the doctrine of the Five Pillars of Islam or, as it is also known, the Five Fundamentals of Faith.45 They include the creed (shahda), prayer (salat), almsgiving (zakat), Ramadan (sawm or fast), and pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj). As theology professors and Christian converts from Islam, Ergun Mehmet Caner and Emir Fethi Caner write, “The Pillars are non-negotiable. They are not to be questioned, but believed to the utmost. To criticize the five pillars is, in fact, paramount to treason, perceived as heresy and blasphemy, punishable in many Muslim countries by imprisonment or worse.”46 Although politics and governance of space is a topic we will discuss in more detail later, it is worth pointing out that government-imposed punishment for dishonoring the Five Pillars is not possible in a secular society. Such actions would require government officials to serve the will of Allah and his Prophet. This type of power arrangement is best described as a theocracy. Since Allah is liable to punish towns and nations for their sins, puritan Islam necessarily requires a theocracy to ensure adherence to the Qur'an and safety from Allah's wrath.
* Since Allah is liable to punish towns and nations for their sins, puritan Islam necessarily requires a theocracy to ensure adherence to the Qur'an and safety from Allah's wrath.
* Islam is a religion in which all races are allowed; however, as the location of Mecca and Islam's emphasis on Arabic show, the faith does have an ethnocentric orientation that elevates Saudi Arabia and its culture to a higher plane.
* the Qur'an does not obligate Muslims to welcome unbelievers to their tables, symbolically or in reality.
* high-minded compromises and self-effacing admissions of guilt feelings do not appease fundamentalist
* the Qur'an is quite clear about how it divides humanity
* Followers of puritan Islam will certainly not be swayed by policies designed to move them into the mainstream of secular society. At the same time, they are likely to see the economic wealth of Europe as a gift to them from Allah.
* European Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia (EMCRX)
* When calamities like hurricanes strike the non-Muslim world, puritans will not likely be inclined to provide relief to recipients of Allah's geotheokolasis
* To the puritan Muslim, there cannot be an innocent victim of nature; in the puritan mind, natural disasters are just one of the forms of punishment Allah uses against non-Muslims and unbelievers.
* The concept of multiple nations, as Muhammad imagined it, was a product of groups of people rejecting Allah's communications.
* Divisions within humanity are, therefore, the result of sin, but Allah continues to guide those people, including nations, that he finds worthy
* there is scant evidence suggesting that Islam, in its purest form, is a religion of peace when challenged by social forces emerging from people with opposing geotheological views.
* interestingly, the German dictator admired Islam's capacity to dismiss practices of liberal governance in favor of right-wing fascism
* A society that promotes and celebrates issues such as religious tolerance, gender equity, gay marriage, and separation of mosque and state is alien to historic Islam
* Muslim groups, who are using minority status as a vehicle to escape public scrutiny, can increase their influence on the policies that shape the social and political landscapes of the United States.
* Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God
* The puritan inspired by a literal reading of the Qur'an sees no disconnect between mosque and state.
* Like in other countries, religion in Indonesia is more than just a function of personal belief; it is also a public expression that geotheologically connects the individual and community to the nation itself
* Currently, Hamas operates with a $70 million annual budget, and almost half of it comes from Iran
* Israel is a wealthy, well-watered land. Its per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is over $20,000 while in Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon it ranges between $3,400 and $5,000. At only $12,000 per person, even the production of oil-rich Saudi Arabia pales in comparison to Israel's economic vitality.
* none of the early churches founded by Jesus' disciples denied his deity.
* Qur'an merges Christianity and Judaism into an alliance against Islam
* In 1946, just two years before the rebirth of Israel, some 13 percent of the population in Palestine lived in small, Christian enclaves. By 2000, the percentage of Christians living there had dwindled to a miniscule 2.1 percent.
* There is no separation of religion and state in the OIC, and it is odd that Turkey, a country with no official religion, is a member.
* Qur'an sees the children of Israel as a fallen and divinely punished people with no justification for being reunited as the modern state of Israel.

* Humans don’t seem well-designed for dispassionate intellectual discourse about domains that have profound personal relevance.
* We are the descendants of those who knew when to cut their losses.

* Let’s hope that it’s not true; and if it is true, let’s hope that it does not become widely known.
* All behavior patterns can in principle be altered by environmental intervention
* Constants do not count in mating decisions.
* Henry Kissinger once remarked that power is the most potent aphrodisiac
* Women on the mating market look for “eligible” men. The word eligible is a euphemism for “not having his resources already committed elsewhere.” The frequency with which the word appears in the combination “eligible bachelor” reveals the mating desires of women. When women append an adverb to this phrase, it becomes “most eligible bachelor,” referring not to the man’s eligibility but rather to his social status and the magnitude of his resources. It is a euphemism for the highest-status, most resource-laden unattached man around.
* Averaged over all cultures, women prefer men who are roughly three and a half years older.
* Resources prove most beneficial when they are predictable.
* Although resources can often be directly observed, commitment cannot be.
* Beauty is in the adaptations of the beholder.
* acquiring a physically attractive mate enhances a man’s status more than a woman’s.
* having an unattractive mate hurts a man’s status more than a woman’s.
* Age is the monster figure of the gay world
* Each increment in income is accompanied by a decrease in the age of the woman sought.
* Beauty is not merely skin deep. It reflects internal reproductive capabilities.
* Hearts have as many changing moods as the face has expressions.
* commitment is gauged from repeated signals over a period of time.
* men, in order to attract women, act more polite than they really are, appear to be more considerate than they really are, and seem more vulnerable than they really are.

* And their still-growing obsession with method rather than purpose strikes me as psychotic.
* A civilization unable to differentiate between illusion and reality is usually believed to be at the tail end of its existence
* The undoubted sign of a society well under control or in decline is that language has ceased to be a means of communication and has become instead a shield for those who master it.

* power depends not on the effect with which they use that knowledge but on the effectiveness with which they control its use.
* among the illusions which have invested our civilization is an absolute belief that the solution to our problems must be a more determined application of rationally organized expertise.
* The weakness of rationally based power can be seen in the way it views criticism as an even more negative force than a medieval king might have done.
* This depression, of proportions as great if not greater than that of the 1930s, still engulfs us. None of our governments appear to have any idea of how to end it. How could they? The essence of rational leadership is control justified by expertise. To admit failure is to admit loss of control. Officially, therefore, we haven’t had a depression since the 1930s. And since most experts — the economists, for example — are part of the system, instead of being commentators in any real, independent sense, they contribute to the denial of reality. In other words, there is a constant need in our civilization to prefer illusions over reality, a need to deny our perceptions.

* The realities of contemporary capitalism are central to our problems. Here is a term which has travelled far from the old concepts that still account for the vocabulary we use to describe the use of private property. Curiously enough, the word capitalist and all the supporting notions still seem to refer to the ownership of the means of production and to the earning of money and power through the successful working of that production. But most Western corporations are controlled by managers, not owners — managers who are virtually interchangeable with military staff officers and government bureaucrats.

50 Philosophy Classics

*Tom Butler-Bowdon*  (4294967656)

* it is what we do not know that matters, because it is always the unforeseen that changes our world, both personal and public.
* Philosophers have raised a dust and then complain they cannot see,
* , he argues that we are a “machine for jumping to conclusions,” wired more to keep alive and respond to threats than to perceive accurately. Nassim Nicholas Taleb also takes up this theme, noting that we believe we understand more of what’s going on in the world than we actually do; we often wrongly ascribe meaning to events after they’ve happened, creating a story; and we overvalue facts, statistics, and categories, which make us feel comfortable that we can predict the future. Our shock at unexpected events shows just how illusory is this feeling that we are in control. And yet, we wouldn’t attempt half the things we do if we had a more accurate picture of what we can achieve in a certain timeframe. Seen this way, error is not a defect of the human condition, but part of its eventual glory. Indeed, a
* free will is an illusion: our actions are the product of brain states, which are themselves the result of prior causes, which in turn are generated by a universe over which we have zero control.
* The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.
* Hegel, however, argued that objective analysis is an illusion, because things only exist in the context of the observer’s perception of them; consciousness is as much a part of science as the world of objects that it purports to analyze.
* knowledge does not proceed in a neat line upward, with one discovery building on another; rather, each age has a completely different lens through which it views the world, and something is perceived to be real only if the lens allows it to be seen.
* The limits of my language means the limits of my world.”
* “Philosophy is the struggle against the bewitchmentof our minds by means of language.”
* Language is about meaning, not words. Yet languagecannot express every kind of meaning.
* Language does not break things into logical pieces, but, if anything, works to make the representation of actual objects unimportant next to their intended use.
* We feel that they do not “speak our language” – that is, our language of meaning, not actual words.
* “[Compare] the reaction to the financial meltdown of September 2008 with the Copenhagen conference of 2009: save the planet from global warming (alternatively: save the AIDS patients, save those dying for lack of funds for expensive treatments and operations, save the starving children, and so on) – all this can wait a little bit, but the call ‘Save the banks!’ is an unconditional imperative which demands and receives immediate action. The panic was here absolute, a trans-national, non-partisan unity was immediately established, all grudges between world leaders momentarily forgotten in order to avertcatastrophe. We may worry as much as we want about the global realities, but it is Capital which is the Real of our lives.”
* Part of the problem of capitalism, Žižek says, is that it has shifted from its “Protestant ethic” roots to become merely a culture of envy and consumerism. This means that all kinds of social problems and contradictions are expected to be solved through exchange. Examples include campaigns to give to starving children from developing countries that carry the message “Give money – and you don’t have to think about the real causes of their conditions!”; and companies like TOMS Shoes, which give a free pair of shoes to very poor people for every pair you buy. In neither case is there a need to take any social action; money and the market will absolve you of all guilt.
* This is the paradox of public space: even if everyone knows an unpleasant fact, stating it publicly changes everything.”
* Why are so many problems today perceived as problems of intolerance, rather than as problems of inequality, exploitation, or injustice?
* Tolerance, Žižek has said in interviews, is just a “decaffeinated way of seeing the Other” in society.
* You can do what you decide to do, but you cannot decide what you will decide to do.”
* Frankfurt mentions a recollection by Fania Pascal of her friend Wittgenstein, who called her while she was in hospital having her tonsils out. When she told him, post-operation, that she felt like “a dog that had just been run over,” he was disgusted, noting that “You don’t know how a dog feels when it is run over.” Wittgenstein was not standing up for dogs’ feelings, but rather the famous linguistic analyst felt that Pascal was not making the proper effort with language. She was neither stating the facts of her own feelings, nor could she know how a dog felt. Though Wittgenstein’s reaction was obviously over the top, Frankfurt draws from it to fashion his own definition of bullshit: that it is not simply outright lying, and indeed often stops short of lying, but is rather a lack of any concern whether something is true or not.
* The black swan effect has made a mockery of attempts to curb uncertainty, whether in the form of fancy financial algorithms that purport to eliminate risk, or the predictions of social scientists. Think about your own life: how many things, from meeting your spouse to the profession you entered, came according to plan or on schedule? Who expected that you would be fired, exiled, enriched, or impoverished? Taleb observes that “Black Swan logic makes what you don’t know far more relevant than what you do know,” because it is the unexpected that shapes our lives. And if that is so, why do we keep believing that things will go as they have done in the past? Our mind, he says, suffers from a “triplet of opacity”:
* almost no discovery, no technologies of note, came from design and planning
* “In our society, real power does not happen to lie in the political system, it lies in the private economy: that’s where the decisions are made about what’s produced, how much is produced, what’s consumed, where investment takes place, who has jobs, who controls the resources, and so on and so forth.”
* Real discovery begins with the recognition of anomalies, or nature acting in a way that it is not meant to.
* is better to create policies that lead people toward virtue than to enforce tough punishments for anyone who transgresses a law:
* Without knowing the force of words, it is impossible to know men.”
* Our lives are essentially the working out of our wills within the spirit and limitations of the age in which we live. “
* The riddle of the age,” Emerson says, “has for each a private solution.”
* nature is not sentimental,
* is better for you to be free of fear and lying on a bed of straw than to own a couch of gold and lavish table and yet have no peace of mind.”
* he also concludes that while it was impossible to prove that God exists, it was also not possible to prove that God did not exist.
* for he who always hopes for the best becomes old, deceived by life, and he who is always prepared for the worst becomes old prematurely; but he who has faith, retains eternal youth.”
* Reason is a creation of human minds, he concludes, and therefore cannot be relied on to reveal eternal truth.
* Language depends on common assent to its meaning,
* e operational criterion for what counted as a war crime at Nuremberg was: in other words, it was considered a legitimate defense if you could show that the Americans and the British did the same thing … And this is all stated straight out – like if you read the book by Telford Taylor, the American prosecutor at the trials, this is the way he describes it; he’s very positive about the whole thing. If the West had done it, it wasn’t a crime; it was only a crime if the Germans had done it and we hadn’t.”
* Economies are never framed in terms of what is best for people who actually work, Chomsky says, but for capital itself
* We create biases based on initial, incomplete knowledge, or weave a story out of limited facts.
* System 1 is biased to believe and confirm, not to question. This type of thinking is always looking for links between events and for causality, even when there is none. We like to weave causality into events that are actually random, and this activity is supported by the fact that random processes can seem or look very nonrandom. “The tendency to see patterns in randomness is overwhelming,” Kahneman says.
* like the man who dreams of running away with his mistress and, once he gets the opportunity, is shocked that it does not make him happy, the transition to capitalism has only served to highlight its flaws

The Soul of the Marionette: A Short Enquiry into Human Freedom
**************************************************************

*John Gray*  (4294969275)

* freedom is not simply a relationship between human beings: it is, above all, a state of the soul in which conflict has been left behind.
* What those who follow these traditions want most is not any kind of freedom of choice. Instead, what they long for is freedom from choice.
* If one of Kleist’s marionettes were somehow to achieve self-awareness, Gnosticism would be its religion. In the most ambitious versions of scientific materialism, human beings are marionettes: puppets on genetic strings, which by an accident of evolution have become self-aware. Unknown to those who most ardently profess it, the boldest secular thinkers are possessed by a version of mystical religion. At present, Gnosticism is the faith of people who believe themselves to be machines.
* Augustine tried to resolve the conundrum by suggesting that evil was the absence of goodness – a fall from grace that came about through the misuse of free will
* The crimes of medieval Christendom were worse than those of antiquity,
* Creating an artificial human being was an attempt to defy natural law – a modern version of the alchemist’s dream.
* Humans have too little self-knowledge to be able to fashion a higher version of themselves.
* Kelvin is left alone with the mystery of the ocean. He would like the Rheya he knew and loved on Earth to return, but accepts that this is impossible: ‘We all know that we are material creatures, subject to the laws of physiology and physics, and not even the power of all our feelings combined can defeat those laws. All we can do is detest them.’ He does not believe the ocean would respond to the tragedy of two human beings. Descending to the ocean’s surface and landing on a soft, porous island that resembles the ruins of an ancient town after it has been devastated by an earthquake, Kelvin asks himself whether he must go on living on this inscrutable planet. ‘I hoped for nothing. And yet I lived in expectation … I knew nothing, and I persisted in the faith that the time of cruel miracles was not past.’
* did not deny that they involved a departure from conventional norms of sanity.
* In the human world as Powys saw it, nothing lasts; but neither does anything really change
* Famously adaptable, the human animal quickly learns to live with violence and soon comes to find satisfaction in it.
* Modern humanity insists violence is inhuman. Everyone says nothing is dearer to them than life – except perhaps freedom, for which some assert they would willingly die
* There is something repugnant in the notion that endemic warfare in small and weak states is a result of their backwardness.
* For Wiener science was a game played against nature.
* Denied any prospect of a lifelong career, lacking pensions or savings, the former middle classes can expect a life of precarious insecurity for the foreseeable future.
* modern governments often have no clear picture of what they are doing, let alone of its unintended consequences.
* As capitalism has developed, the division of labour in society has become more fluid. No one can rely on having any particular type of employment, and the idea that work can be a means to self-realization is increasingly unreal.
* By the time he killed himself Debord had come to think the spectacle was indestructible. A society in which it had reached its full development, he writes in a commentary on his original ideas that he published in 1988, displays five mutually reinforcing features: ‘incessant technological renewal; integration of state and economy; generalised secrecy; unanswerable lies; an eternal present’. Taken together, these features removed any possibility of revolutionary change.

* terrorist activity as a strategy practised by states against their own citizens in a time when these states were losing legitimacy.
* Power never resides only in publicly visible institutions
* Interpreting history as the work of a conspiracy is a backhanded compliment to human rationality
* Human beings may behave like puppets, but no one is pulling the strings.
* If we are authors of our lives, it is only in retrospect.
* We think we have some kind of privileged access to our own motives and intentions. In fact we have no clear insight into what moves us to live as we do
* Sudden extinction of ways of life is the human norm.
* The same is true of species. Evolution has no attachment to the attributes modern thinkers imagine are essentially human – self-awareness, rationality and the like. Quite the contrary: by enabling the increase in human power that has taken place over the past few centuries, these very attributes may bring about humanity’s obsolescence.
* Humans may turn out to be like the Neanderthals, a byway in evolution
* It may seem curious that science can enable us to make such machines and yet be unable to tell us what it is that we have made
* Science is a method of inquiry, not a view of the world.
* The idea that consciousness is a mystery is a prejudice inherited from monotheism. The early seventeenth-century French philosopher René Descartes believed that animals other than humans are insensate machines. Obviously, this was a restatement in rationalist terms of the Christian belief that only humans have souls. Even if mind and matter were categorically distinct, that would not mean humans alone have minds. It was reported that in order to test his theories, Descartes used to throw animals out of the window and observe their reactions. Looking at behaviour of this kind, one might reasonably conclude that humans are the senseless machines.
* What seems to be singularly human is not consciousness or free will but inner conflict – the contending impulses that divide us from ourselves. No other animal seeks the satisfaction of its desires and at the same time curses them as evil; spends its life terrified of death while being ready to die in order to preserve an image of itself; kills its own species for the sake of dreams. Not self-awareness but the split in the self is what makes us human.
* civilization implies restraint in the use of force; but when it serves noble-sounding goals, violence has a glamour that is irresistible
* Accepting the fact of unknowing makes possible an inner freedom very different from that pursued by Gnostics

* Ever since Marcel Proust’s In Search of Lost Time, what can be called “how-I-became-a-writer” stories have flourished in the world. Shishōsetsu from left to right is no doubt a variant. You may even detect in my novel that self-complacent, self-congratulatory tone that is characteristic of such stories. Yet my novel is also something else. For it is not just a how-I-became-a-writer story; it is also a how-I-became-a-Japanese-writer story. And this story is inseparably connected to another story that runs parallel to it and yet is a far more sober tale, full of regret: a how-I-failed-to-become-a-writer-in-the-English-language story. The female protagonist of Shishōsetsu from left to right went to the United States at a privileged age, a time when she was still young enough to adopt a new language and make it her own. Why was she so fixated on the Japanese language—a language that does not even belong to a major linguistic family, one that’s used only in an island country in the Far East, one that’s singularly isolated? In other words, why didn’t she choose to adopt English? Why didn’t she choose “correctly,” like many others who moved to the United States at an age similar to hers—those who are now writing how-I-became-an-English-writer stories? How did she end up making such a terribly wrong choice? Why did it never even occur to her that she had such a choice until the choice was forever lost?
* Awareness often comes to us terribly late. It finally knocks on our mind’s door months, years, sometimes decades after the scene, incident, or conversation that prompted it. Preconceptions we have unknowingly acquired keep us from seeing things for what they are. Blocked by preconceptions, we cease to think. Nonetheless, as time matures, we are sometimes graced with an occasion when truth reveals its simple, unforced, and also brutal self.
* Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism
* One cannot ask a book that treats oranges why it fails to treat apples.
* In fact, “arcane” is Anderson’s word of choice in describing Latin, the sacred language of Europe. He repeatedly uses the word to emphasize his understanding of a sacred language as one that is comprehensible to only a few. The word itself derives from the Latin arcanus, which means “closed” or “hidden”; arcanus in turn derives from arca, meaning “a chest.” Thus if the sacred language is “arcane,” texts written in it are, for the vast majority of people, hidden in “a chest”—or, to use the expression of the Internet age, something people cannot access. Because of this “arcane” nature, the sacred language inevitably came to be abused by the literate minority, who constituted “adepts, strategic strata in a cosmological hierarchy of which the apex was divine.” To hold on to their power, these people kept the acts of reading and writing “arcane.” Indeed, for a thousand years, translating the Latin Bible into other languages was forbidden. Anderson points out that even at the dawn of the Reformation, the Roman papacy, struggling to protect its Latin fortress, compiled the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (Index of prohibited books) to prevent the spread of vernacular publications. In Imagined Communities, sacred languages thus end up as a villainous tool through which past oppressors tried to entrap the masses in ignorance.

Yet scrolls, even if they are placed in a golden box, differ from other treasures in a critical way. They surely need to exist as physical objects, but without the act of reading, they are nothing more than sheets of parchment or paper decorated with dots and squiggles. The essence of the written word lies not in the written word itself but in the act of reading.

The Power of Habit
******************

*Charles Duhigg*  (4294968714)

* “All our life, so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits,” William James wrote in 1892.prl.2 Most of the choices we make each day may feel like the products of well-considered decision making, but they’re not. They’re habits. And though each habit means relatively little on its own, over time, the meals we order, what we say to our kids each night, whether we save or spend, how often we exercise, and the way we organize our thoughts and work routines have enormous impacts on our health, productivity, financial security, and happiness. One paper published by a Duke University researcher in 2006 found that more than 40 percent of the actions people performed each day weren’t actual decisions, but habits.prl.3
* Habits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort. Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any routine into a habit, because habits allow our minds to ramp down more often. This effort-saving instinct is a huge advantage. An efficient brain requires less room, which makes for a smaller head, which makes childbirth easier and therefore causes fewer infant and mother deaths. An efficient brain also allows us to stop thinking constantly about basic behaviors, such as walking and choosing what to eat, so we can devote mental energy to inventing spears, irrigation systems, and, eventually, airplanes and video games.
* When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making. It stops working so hard, or diverts focus to other tasks
* Habits never really disappear. They’re encoded into the structures of our brain
* “We’ve done experiments where we trained rats to run down a maze until it was a habit, and then we extinguished the habit by changing the placement of the reward,” Ann Graybiel, a scientist at MIT who oversaw many of the basal ganglia experiments, told me. “Then one day, we’ll put the reward in the old place, and put in the rat, and, by golly, the old habit will reemerge right away. Habits never really disappear. They’re encoded into the structures of our brain, and that’s a huge advantage for us, because it would be awful if we had to relearn how to drive after every vacation. The problem is that your brain can’t tell the difference between bad and good habits, and so if you have a bad one, it’s always lurking there, waiting for the right cues and rewards.”1.20
* habits emerge without our permission
* This is how new habits are created: by putting together a cue, a routine, and a reward, and then cultivating a craving that drives the loop.2.26 Take, for instance, smoking. When a smoker sees a cue—say, a pack of Marlboros—her brain starts anticipating a hit of nicotine. Just the sight of cigarettes is enough for the brain to crave a nicotine rush. If it doesn’t arrive, the craving grows until the smoker reaches, unthinkingly, for a Marlboro.
* If you want to start running each morning, it’s essential that you choose a simple cue (like always lacing up your sneakers before breakfast or leaving your running clothes next to your bed) and a clear reward (such as a midday treat, a sense of accomplishment from recording your miles, or the endorphin rush you get from a jog). But countless studies have shown that a cue and a reward, on their own, aren’t enough for a new habit to last. Only when your brain starts expecting the reward—craving the endorphins or sense of accomplishment—will it become automatic to lace up your jogging shoes each morning. The cue, in addition to triggering a routine, must also trigger a craving for the reward to come.2.29
* Want to craft a new eating habit? When researchers affiliated with the National Weight Control Registry—a project involving more than six thousand people who have lost more than thirty pounds—looked at the habits of successful dieters, they found that 78 percent of them ate breakfast every morning, a meal cued by a time of day.2.32 But most of the successful dieters also envisioned a specific reward for sticking with their diet—a bikini they wanted to wear or the sense of pride they felt when they stepped on the scale each day—something they chose carefully and really wanted. They focused on the craving for that reward when temptations arose, cultivated the craving into a mild obsession. And their cravings for that reward, researchers found, crowded out the temptation to drop the diet. The craving drove the habit loop.2.33
* Habits are a three-step loop—the cue, the routine, and the reward
* The physical effects of alcohol are often one of the least rewarding parts of drinking for addicts.
* fundamental principles of habits: Often, we don’t really understand the cravings driving our behaviors until we look for them.
* For some habits, however, there’s one other ingredient that’s necessary: belief.
* belief seems critical. You don’t have to believe in God, but you do need the capacity to believe that things will get better.
* We know that a habit cannot be eradicated—it must, instead, be replaced
* defines addiction as “a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory and related circuitry.… Addiction is characterized by impairment in behavioral control, craving, inability to consistently abstain, and diminished relationships.”
* The habits that matter most are the ones that, when they start to shift, dislodge and remake other patterns.
* Keystone habits offer what is known within academic literature as “small wins.” They help other habits to flourish by creating new structures, and they establish cultures where change becomes contagious.
* In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association, after years of internal debate, rewrote the definition of homosexuality so it was no longer a mental illness
* At the core of that education is an intense focus on an all-important habit: willpower. Dozens of studies show that willpower is the single most important keystone habit for individual success.5.1 In a 2005 study, for instance, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania analyzed 164 eighth-grade students, measuring their IQs and other factors, including how much willpower the students demonstrated, as measured by tests of their self-discipline.
* Students who exerted high levels of willpower were more likely to earn higher grades in their classes and gain admission into more selective schools. They had fewer absences and spent less time watching television and more hours on homework. “Highly self-disciplined adolescents outperformed their more impulsive peers on every academic-performance variable,” the researchers wrote. “Self-discipline predicted academic performance more robustly than did IQ. Self-discipline also predicted which students would improve their grades over the course of the school year, whereas IQ did not.… Self-discipline has a bigger effect on academic performance than does intellectual talent.”5.2
* the best way to strengthen willpower and give students a leg up, studies indicate, is to make it into a habit
* Sometimes it looks like people with great self-control aren’t working hard—but that’s because they’ve made it automatic,
* Willpower is a learnable skill, something that can be taught the same way kids learn to do math and say “thank you
* Willpower isn’t just a skill. It’s a muscle, like the muscles in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there’s less power left over for other things.”
* If you want to do something that requires willpower—like going for a run after work—you have to conserve your willpower muscle during the day,”

* The same kinds of shifts are possible at any company where institutional habits—through thoughtlessness or neglect—have created toxic truces. A company with dysfunctional habits can’t turn around simply because a leader orders it. Rather, wise executives seek out moments of crisis—or create the perception of crisis—and cultivate the sense that something must change, until everyone is finally ready to overhaul the patterns they live with each day.

Deep Simplicity
***************

*John Gribbin*  (4294967627)

* all this business of chaos and complexity is based on two simple ideas – the sensitivity of a system to its starting conditions, and feedback
* that’s a bit like saying that ‘all there is’ to the special theory of relativity is that the speed of light is the same for all observers.
* the complicated behaviour of the world we see around us – even the living world – is merely ‘surface complexity arising out of deep simplicity’.
* Martin Luther to comment in 1539 that ‘This fool wishes to reverse the entire science of astronomy; but sacred Scripture tells us that Joshua commanded the Sun to stand still, and not the Earth.’
* Galileo later riposted: ‘The Bible shows the way to go to Heaven, not the way the heavens go.
* the lack of solutions to the three-body problem is not caused by our human deficiencies as mathematicians; it is built into the laws of mathematics.
* the three-body problem is completely intractable if the three objects are about the same size (that is, mass) as each other and are at roughly equal distances from each other
* there is nothing in Newton’s laws to reveal the direction of time, and the laws work just as well if time is running the other way
* The other strange feature of Maxwell’s equations is that, like Newton’s equations, they have no inbuilt arrow of time
* the inevitable increase in entropy defines a direction of time, an arrow pointing from the ordered past into the disordered future
* In the language of thermodynamics, by the time a system reaches equilibrium it has forgotten its initial conditions
* Away from equilibrium, a flow of energy can, under the right circumstances, create order spontaneously.
* Poincare took Laplace’s argument to its logical conclusion. He proved, using the full rigour of mathematics, that if you have a box of gas containing a definite number of particles (as many as you like, as long as it is not actually infinite) and the particles strictly obey Newton’s laws of motion, then after a sufficiently long interval of time the distribution of the particles in the box must return to its original state, with each particle moving in the same direction and at the same speed that it was moving to start with.
* Poincare recurrence time, or Poincare cycle time
* sensitivity of the weather (and other complex systems) to initial conditions is sometimes referred to as ‘the butterfly effect‘,
* natural processes would then drive the model atmosphere into one of a relatively small number of stable states – what we would now call attractors,
* Figure 3.1b A key feature of the Feigenbaum diagram is that it is self-similar. A small piece of the diagram blown up in scale by the right amount looks exactly like the original diagram.
* just as mathematics had to come to terms with the idea that there is an infinity of numbers between every rational number, so it would have to come to terms with the idea that there are entities with intermediate, non-integer dimensions.
* The Peano curve is a line that is more than a line, ‘trying’ to be a plane
* the Cantor set is a line that is less than a line, ‘trying’ to be a point.
* Dissipation of energy is an essential feature of non-equilibrium thermodynamics,
* Equilibrium itself is of no intrinsic interest, because nothing happens there.
* But how things move towards equilibrium can be very interesting.
* More information implies less entropy,
* the shortest description of the Universe is the Universe itself.
* Darwin’s theory is to evolution what Newton’s theory is to gravity,
* we do not yet have an evolutionary equivalent of Einstein’s theory of gravity, a complete theory of evolution going beyond Darwin’s theory to incorporate all the facts known today
* to many people ‘complex’ means ‘complicated’, and there is an automatic assumption that if a system is complicated it will be difficult to understand.
* Neither assumption is necessarily correct. A complex system is really just a system that is made up of several simpler components interacting with one another.
* complex numbers are really very simple, and contain only two components, scarcely justifying the use of the term ‘complex’ at all.
* Large ‘events’ (earthquakes, stretches of coastline, pieces of potato) are more rare
* you can express this by saying that the frequency of an event is equal to 1 divided by some power of its size
* Turning this around, you can say that the size of an event is proportional to 1 over some power of its frequency,
* The conclusion is that although there is a lot of noise in the weather system, and this is largely  noise (which is an interesting and important discovery in itself), there is also a genuine upward trend in temperature linked to human activities. The particularly interesting thing about the fact that the noise in the weather system is  noise is, of course, the same as the interesting thing about earthquakes obeying a power law. It means that events of any size can happen at any time, but that big events (in this case, big departures from average temperature) are rare. Traditionally, insurance companies and civic planners have worked out the odds against extreme events on an historical basis. They look at how often a particular type and size of event (say, a severe drought) has occurred in the past, and guess that it will happen with the same frequency in future. They even talk about things like a ‘once in a hundred years’ drought. But this is only half the story. The  signal tells us that such events actually obey a power law. And that means that if you get a ‘once in a hundred years’ drought one summer, the odds of getting a second drought of the same severity the following year are exactly the same as if there had not been a drought that year. It is not safe to assume that after one ‘once in a hundred years’ drought it will be a hundred years before the next one happens. Equally, though,  noise implies that a record-breaking drought could be followed by a record-breaking freeze. Next year might be the coldest ever recorded, without this in any way invalidating the greenhouse effect hypothesis, thanks to a random fluctuation of the natural weather system. That is why it is so important to look at long-term trends, not just one-off events.
* as the number of connections in the network exceeds half the number of nodes, it switches very quickly from one rather boring state (a lot of buttons with a few connections between them) to another stable state with a lot more structure, but in which there is little scope for further change.

* A rose-red city, half as old as time'
* A famous archaeologist dug up a bronze-age warrior with a beautifully preserved face mask and exulted: 'I have gazed upon the face of Agamemnon.' He was being poetically awed at his penetration of fabled antiquity. To find Agamemnon in our pile of books, you'd have to stoop to a level about halfway up your shins. Somewhere in the vicinity you'd find Petra ('A rose-red city, half as old as time'), Ozymandias, king of kings ('Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair') and that enigmatic wonder of the ancient world the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Ur of the Chaldees, and Uruk the city of the legendary hero Gilgamesh had their day slightly earlier and you'd find tales of their foundation a little higher up your legs. Around here is the oldest date of all, according to the seventeenth-century archbishop James Ussher, who calculated 4004  BC as the date of the creation of Adam and Eve.
* The art in thinking of analogies for large numbers is not to go off the scale of what people can comprehend. If

* The mystic is content to bask in the wonder and revel in a mystery that we were not 'meant' to understand. The scientist feels the same wonder but is restless, not content; recognizes the mystery as profound, then adds, 'But we're working on it.'
* Premature erection of alleged philosophical problems is sometimes a smokescreen for mischief.
* A calculated dumbing down is the worst: condescending and patronizing.
* I worry that to promote science as all fun and larky and easy is to store up trouble for the future. Real science can be hard (well, challenging, to give it a more positive spin) but, like classical literature or playing the violin, worth the struggle. If children are lured into science, or any other worthwhile occupation, by the promise of easy fun, what are they going to do when they finally have to confront the reality? Recruiting advertisements for the army rightly don't promise a picnic: they seek young people dedicated enough to stand the pace. 'Fun' sends the wrong signals and might attract people to science for the wrong reasons. Literary scholarship is in danger of becoming similarly undermined. Idle students are seduced into a debased 'Cultural Studies', on the promise that they will spend their time deconstructing soap operas, tabloid princesses and Tellytubbies. Science, like proper literary studies, can be hard and challenging but science is—also like proper literary studies—wonderful. Science  can pay its way but, like great art, it shouldn't have to. And we shouldn't need whacky personalities and fun explosions to persuade us of the value of a life spent finding out why we have life in the first place.

* Clarke's Third Law does not work in reverse. Given that 'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic', it does not follow that 'Any magical claim that anybody may make at any time is indistinguishable from a technological advance that will come in the future.' Yes, there have been occasions when authoritative sceptics have come away with egg on their pontificating faces. But a far greater number of magical claims have been made and never vindicated. A few things that would surprise us today will come true in the future. But far more things that would surprise us today will not come true in the future. The trick is to sort out the minority from the rubbish—from claims that will forever remain in the realm of fiction and magic.
* no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavours to establish.
* It is easy to see why natural selection—the survival of the fittest—might penalize an experimental and sceptical turn of mind and favour simple credulity in children.
* How can we tell which apparent patterns are genuine, which random and meaningless? Methods exist, and they belong in the science of statistics and experimental design. I want to spend a little more time explaining a few of the principles, though not the details, of statistics. Statistics can largely be seen as the art of distinguishing pattern from randomness. Randomness means lack of pattern. There are various ways of explaining the ideas of randomness and pattern. Suppose I claim that I can tell girls' handwriting from boys'. If I am right, this would have to mean that there is a real pattern relating sex to handwriting. A sceptic might doubt this, agreeing that handwriting varies from person to person but denying that there is a sex-related pattern to this variation. How should you decide whether my claim, or the sceptic's, is right? It is no use just accepting my word for it. Like a superstitious Las Vegas gambler, I could easily have mistaken a lucky streak for a real, repeatable skill. In any case, you have every right to demand evidence. What evidence should satisfy you? The answer is evidence that is publicly recorded, and properly analysed.
* Statistics can largely be seen as the art of distinguishing pattern from randomness.
* Remember the wisdom out of the old days...
* Personification is sometimes a useful device, and for critics to accuse us of taking it literally is almost as stupid as taking it literally in the first place

Pakistan
********

*Anatol Lieven*  (4294967700)

* If I were to jump on a box and preach revolution,
* Society is strong above all in the form of the kinship networks which are by far the most important foci of most people’s loyalty.
* Kinship is central to the weakness of the Pakistani state,
* Whatever the law, civil or military, the poor are always the victims of oppression.’
* In Pakistan, however, as in India, the vast majority of human rights abuses come not from state strength, but from state weakness.
* democracy is representative not only of the people, but of all those classes, groups and institutions through which the popular will is refracted until it eventually finds some kind of distorted reflection in elected institution
* modern Europe has generated far more dreadful atrocities than anything Islam or South Asia has yet
* One of the main problems for Pakistan is that our democrats have tried to be dictators and our dictators have tried to be democrats. So the democratic governments have not developed democracy and the dictatorships have not developed the country. That would in fact have required them to be much more dictatorial.
* Elitism is one of the curses of Pakistan’s official judicial system, but also the source of whatever progressive elements it contains. T
* Formally speaking, the introduction of Shariah law in Pakistan is quite unnecessary, because a series of laws beginning with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in the 1970s have declared that all Pakistani laws must be in conformity with the Shariah. In practice, however, this is irrelevant. Legally, it has only added to the confusion and contradiction that marks Pakistan’s legal scene. Much more importantly, however, it misses the point that the campaign for the Shariah is not so much about the content of the law as about popular access to the law, the speed of the law, and who gets to enforce the law.
* f you believed all the stories you hear concerning violence in the countryside, ‘there would hardly be a man left alive or a women left un-raped
* a dangerous intellectual mess is often created by the mixing up of words such as ‘extremism’ and ‘militancy’ with the very different concepts of ‘fundamentalism’ and ‘conservatism’.
* why Islam had allegedly failed to keep West and East Pakistan together, and was continuing to fail to help develop Pakistan as a united and successful society.
* Islam in Pakistan has so far failed in this regard, though things would be even worse without its influence.
* Pakistan has one of the lowest levels of tax collection outside Africa. On the other hand, charitable donation, at almost 5 per cent of GDP, is one of the highest rates in the world.
* state and its own elected representatives – and to see the flag of the Edhi Foundation flying over a concrete shack with a telephone, and the only ambulance in town standing in front. Here, if anywhere in Pakistan, lies the truth of human religion and human morality.
* in Pakistan it is not wealth alone, but wealth plus either kinship or spiritual prestige, or both, that gives political power.
* The traditions and structures which prevent Islamist revolution and civil war also help keep much of the population in a state of backwardness and deference to the elites.
* A majority of known Pakistani terrorists have in fact attended government schools and quite often have a degree of higher education – reflecting yet again the basis for Islamism in the urban lower middle classes rather than the impoverished masses.
* A very large number of ordinary Taleban fighters have had no education at all, and their recruitment owes less to specific Taleban education than to the general atmosphere prevailing in their village
* The Islamists were initially intended to be tools, not allies; and the goal was not Islamist revolution as such, but to further Pakistan’s national interests (as perceived and defined by the Pakistani military and security establishment), above all when it came to attacking those of India.
* Siachen Glacier (possibly the most strategically pointless fight in the entire history of human conflict) initiated by India in 1984.
* Gujarat massacres of 2002, which were orchestrated by the BJP state government (and which claimed, it should be pointed out, at least ten times as many victims as the Mumbai terrorist attacks, while receiving perhaps one-tenth of Western media notice).
* Concerning the Pakistani Taleban and their allies, however, like the military as a whole, the ISI is now committed to the struggle against them, and by the end of 2009 had lost more than seventy of its officers in this fight – some ten times the number of CIA officers killed since 9/11, just as Pakistani military casualties fighting the Pakistani Taleban have been more than double those of the US in Afghanistan.
* The problem with Pakistan’s political and government system is not so much feudalism as what I would have to call South Asian political culture in general. Everyone here seeks personal and family power by all means and then misuses it. The feudals just have more of it, that’s all.
* the ratio of the income of the poorest group in society relative to the richest. In 2002, according to UN statistics, the figure for Pakistan was 30.6, compared to 36.8 for India, 40.8 for the US, and 43.7 for Nigeria.
* It is also worth noting that, as this passage reflects, while women play no role in the outward political behaviour of the family or clan, they are central and can even be dominant when it comes to its internal politics  and the balance of prestige and power between its members. If this appeared in public, it would be a matter of shame and ridicule; but as long as it remains within the extended family, family izzat (honour, or prestige) is not threatened.
* often not saints, but they often need the patience of saints, as well as the courage of wolves, the memory of elephants and the digestion of crocodiles.
* Although Karachi has more than doubled in size over the past twenty years, the city has not lapsed into the shambolic misery that many predicted. It is in fact not merely the best-run city in Pakistan (with the possible exception of Faisalabad) but one of the best-run larger cities of South Asia, without the appalling mass poverty that characterizes most Indian and Bangladeshi cities.
* So one of the biggest factors holding Pakistan together is fear.
* Karachi is the third largest Pathan city after Kabul and Peshawar, and probably the fourth or fifth largest Punjabi city
* Terrorist attacks can do great damage to Pakistan, but to overthrow the state would require an immense spread of the rebellions which broke out in some of the Pathan areas between 2001 and 2009. Above all, to seize power in Pakistan, Islamist militancy would have to seize Lahore.
* while it is difficult enough to argue with anti-Western Pakistanis when they are in the wrong, it is even more difficult to do so when they are in the right.
* Pakistan’s Prussian Bible Belt’: that is to say, the combination of tendencies towards economic dynamism, social mobility, militarist nationalism and Islamist chauvinism to be found in northern and central Punjab.
* Even if political and ethnic violence are included, the murder rate in Karachi at the last count put it twenty-fifth among the great cities of the world

Philosophy: The Classics
************************

*Warburton, Nigel*  (4294968460)

* Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must remain silent.
* Most of what is important in human life lies outside the realm of what can be said meaningfully; it is inexpressible, but no less important for that.
* Language is not simply a medium we use to represent the world. Rather it is more like a tool kit containing a wide range of implements which we use for different purposes
* language sets the limits of our thought, and language is an intrinsically public phenomenon
* At several key points in his argument Plato advocates lying in order to preserve loyalty to the state and to fellow citizens. For instance, there is the so-called ‘noble lie’ of the myth of the metals; there is also the lie about the mating lottery. Many people find this unacceptable. An ideal state should not be founded on deception. Plato, however, seems unconcerned about this. His interest is in the end result and the best way to achieve it, not in moral questions about how this end result is achieved.
* Eudaimonia is often translated as ‘happiness’, but that can be very misleading. It is sometimes also translated as ‘flourishing’, which, although slightly awkward, has more appropriate connotations: it, for instance, suggests the analogy between the flourishing of plants and the flourishing of human beings. Aristotle believes that we all want eudaimonia, by which he means that we all want our lives to go well. A eudaimon life is a life that is successful. It is the kind of life that if we could achieve it we would all choose; the kind of life we would want for those we love. Eudaimonia is always pursued as an end, never a means to an end. We may seek money, for instance, because it provides a means to buy expensive clothes, and we may buy expensive clothes because we believe they will make us more attractive to people we want to attract; we want to attract these people because we believe that they have a capacity to make our lives go well. But it doesn’t make any sense to ask why we want our lives to go well. Eudaimonia can’t serve any other purpose: it is the place where this sort of chain of explanation finishes. It doesn’t make sense to ask ‘Why pursue eudaimonia?’ since, for Aristotle, it is a conceptual truth that this is what all human beings do. Eudaimonia is not the only thing pursued as an end in itself; we may, for instance, listen to music, or spend time with our children, not because we expect to get anything further out of these activities, but because these are the ways we want to while away our time on earth. However, in such cases, we pursue these things because we believe, rightly or wrongly, that they are ingredients in a eudaimon life.

* if you are worried about rotten apples in a barrel you will be well advised to tip out all the apples and examine each one before you replace it in the barrel.

* But Nietzsche’s aim is not simply to replace one morality with another; he wants to call into question the value of morality itself
* For Nietzsche morality is not something fixed for all time to be discovered in the world; rather it is a human creation, and as a consequence moral terms have a history, a history which is influenced by human psychology as well as by the interests of particular group

* We are left recognising that experience of past uniformity of nature is not a completely reliable guide to the future. Just because we have never had an exception to an apparent uniformity of nature, it does not follow that there never could be one. It just makes it improbable that this will occur. As Russell points out, this cuts two ways. We can’t prove the reliability of the principle of induction using experience, since that would be begging the question: using induction to justify the principle of induction. But equally we can’t prove that the future won’t be like the past
* We find ourselves forced to choose, and through our choices we create what we are.
* We are what we are as a result of our position in the economic situation of our time; in particular, our relation to the means of material production shapes our lives and thoughts
* Those in the grip of ideology often see their thought as the outcome of pure thought when in fact it is a product of class interests.
* Popper rejected the idea that science was a process of finding confirmatory evidence: rather, he thought scientists work by formulating bold but falsifiable hypotheses which they then set about refuting.
* Logically no amount of supporting evidence can absolutely confirm an empirical hypothesis, but observations can refute a generalisation.
* An open society for Popper is one that allows individuals to question and reject the presumed authority of those whose power comes merely from tradition or from being part of an establishment. Members of an open society attempt to establish new traditions based on humaneness, freedom, equality and rational assessment
* Plato took pains to curb free thought in his republic, legitimising censorship of any art or other communication that in his view misrepresented reality or encouraged inappropriate emotional engagement. Although purporting to value truth, Plato also argued that members of the lower orders should be kept in their place by means of a noble lie: they should be told that those who are born to rule, the philosopher class, have gold in their blood, those who will be members of the auxiliary class have silver, and the workers iron and coppe

* And if Germans do have systematic minds, this is just as likely to be because their exceedingly erratic mother tongue has exhausted their brains’ capacity to cope with any further irregularity.
* physical changes you undergo during your lifetime will not be passed on to your offsprin
* People in simple cultures might spend a lifetime without seeing objects that are truly blue. Of course, blue is the color of the sky (and, for some of us, the sea). But in the absence of blue materials with any practical significance, the need to find a special name for this great stretch of nothingness is particularly non-pressing.
* Different cultures certainly are not at liberty to carve up the world entirely at whim, as they are bound by the constraints set by nature—both the nature of the human brain and the nature of the world outside
* If we define a “primitive language” as something that resembles the rudimentary “me sleep here” type of English—a language with only a few hundred words and without the grammatical means of expressing any finer nuances—then it is a simple empirical fact that no natural language is primitive. Hundreds of languages of simple tribes have now been studied in depth, but not one of them, be it spoken by the most technologically and sartorially challenged people, is on the “me sleep here” level. So there is no question that Joe and Piers and Tom have got it wrong about “primitive people speak primitive languages.” Linguistic “technology” in the form of sophisticated grammatical structures is not a prerogative of advanced civilizations, but is found even in the languages of the most primitive hunter-gatherers. As the linguist Edward Sapir memorably put it in 1921, when it comes to the complexity of grammatical structures “Plato walks with the Macedonian swineherd, Confucius with the head-hunting savage of Assam.”
* As it happens, the dogma of equal complexity is based on no evidence whatsoever. No one has ever measured the overall complexity of even one single language, not to mention all of them
* There is one area of language whose complexity is generally acknowledged to depend on culture—this is the size of the vocabulary
* The reason for the great difference between languages with and without a written tradition is fairly obvious. In illiterate societies, the size of the vocabulary is severely restricted precisely becau
* In order to compare the complexity of words in the languages of the sample, Perkins chose a list of semantic features like the ones I mentioned above: the indication of plurality on nouns, tense on verbs, and other such bits of information that identify the participants, the time, and the place of events. He then checked how many of these features are expressed within the word, rather than through independent words, in each language. His analysis showed that there was a significant correlation between the level of complexity of a society and the number of distinctions that are expressed inside the word. But contrary to what Joe, Piers, and Tom might expect, it was not the case that sophisticated societies tend to have sophisticated word structures. Quite the opposite: there is an inverse correlation between the complexity of society and of word structure! The simpler the society, the more information it is likely to mark within the word; the more complex the society, the fewer semantic distinctions it is likely to express word-internally.
* languages of large societies are more likely to have simpler word structure, whereas languages of smaller societies are more likely to have many semantic distinctions coded within the word.
* The English language after the Norman Conquest is a case in point: until the eleventh century, English had an elaborate word structure similar to that of modern-day German, but much of this complexity was wiped out in the period after 1066, no doubt because of the contact between speakers of the different languages.
* In fluent speech, there are no real spaces between words, so when two words frequently appear together they can easily fuse into one. In the written language, however, the word takes on a visible independent existence, reinforcing speakers’ perception of the border between words. This doesn’t mean that new fusions ain’t never gonna happen in literate societies. But the rate at which new fusions occur may be substantially reduced. In short, writing may be a counterforce that retards the emergence of more complex word structures.
* what fetters the mind and benumbs the spirit . . . the dogged acceptance of absolutes
* It was difficult not to get carried away by the view. Sapir and Whorf became convinced that the profound differences between languages must have consequences that go far beyond mere grammatical organization and must be related to profound divergence in modes of thought. And so in this heady atmosphere of discovery, a daring idea about the power of language shot to prominence: the claim that our mother tongue determines the way we think and perceive the world. The idea itself was not new—it had been lying around in a raw state for more than a century—but it was distilled in the 1930s into a powerful concoction that then intoxicated a whole generation. Sapir branded this idea the principle of “linguistic relativity,” equating it with nothing less than Einstein’s world-shaking theory. The observer’s perceptions of the world—so ran Sapir’s emendation of Einstein—depend not only on his inertial frame of reference but also on his mother tongue.
* nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, and ablative.
* The mother tongue “is not just the means for representing a truth already recognized but much more to discover the truth that had not been recognized previously.” Since “language is the forming organ of thought,” there must be an intimate relation between the laws of grammar and the laws of thinking. “Thinking,” he concluded, “is dependent not just on language in general but to a certain extent on each individual language
* A seductive idea was thus tossed into the air, an idea that in the 1930s would be taken up (and up and up) at Yale. Humboldt himself never went as far as alleging that our mother tongue can entirely constrain our thoughts and intellectual horizons. He explicitly acknowledged something that in the hullaballoo around Whorf a century later tended to be overlooked, namely that, in principle, any thought can be expressed in any language. The real differences between languages, he argued, are not in what a language is able to express but rather in “what it encourages and stimulates its speakers to do from its own inner force.”
* Language misleads us both by its vocabulary and by its syntax. We must be on our guard in both respects if our logic is not to lead to a false metaphysic.
* Whereas Sapir still kept a few toes on the ground and on the whole was reluctant to spell out the exact form of the alleged tyrannical hold of linguistic categories on the mind, his student Whorf suffered no such qualms. Whorf was to boldly go where no man had gone before, and in a series of ever wilder claims he expounded the power of our mother tongue to influence not just our thoughts and perceptions but even the physics of the cosmos. The grammar of each language, he wrote, “is not merely a reproducing instrument for voicing ideas, but rather is itself the shaper of ideas, the program and guide for the individual’s mental activity, for his analysis of impressions. . . . We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native languages.”
* the verbal system influences thought, which in turn influences the verbal system, all in “manifold reciprocity.”
* For there is one toxic fallacy that runs like quicksilver through all the arguments we have encountered so far, and this is the assumption that the language we happen to speak is a prison-house that limits the concepts we are able to understand
* what unites all these contentions is a premise that is as crude as it is false, namely that “the limits of my language mean the limits of my world,” that the concepts expressed in a language are the same as the concepts its speakers are able to understand, and that the distinctions made in a grammar are the same as the distinctions the speakers are able to conceive
* ? Humboldt went on to say, in somewhat mystical terms, that languages nevertheless differ in what they “encourage and stimulate to do from their own inner force.
* If different languages influence their speakers’ minds in varying ways, this is not because of what each language allows people to think but rather because of the kinds of information each language habitually obliges people to think about
* One of the most tempting and most common of all logical fallacies is to jump from correlation to causation: to assume that just because two facts correlate, one of them was the cause of the other
* plausibility by no means constitutes proof.
* The conventional predictions are that within two to three generations at least half the world’s six thousand or so languages will have disappeared, especially those remote tribal tongues that are really different from what seems natural
* Like most serious problems in life, the latter-day diversity of meanings for “gender” has its roots in ancient Greece.
* In German, a young lady has no sex, while a turnip has. Think what overwrought reverence that shows for the turnip, and what callous disrespect for the girl
* The worst thing about this loss of transparency is that it is a self-propelling process: the less consistent the system becomes, the easier it is to mess it up even further
* no evidence has come to light that our mother tongue imposes limits on our intellectual horizons and constrains our ability to understand concepts or distinctions used in other languages.
* In the second part, we saw that the linguistic conventions of our society can affect aspects of our thought that go beyond language. The demonstrable impact of language on thinking is very different from what was touted in the past. In particular, no evidence has come to light that our mother tongue imposes limits on our intellectual horizons and constrains our ability to understand concepts or distinctions used in other languages. The real effects of the mother tongue are rather the habits that develop through the frequent use of certain ways of expression. The concepts we are trained to treat as distinct, the information our mother tongue continuously forces us to specify, the details it requires us to be attentive to, and the repeated associations it imposes on us—all these habits of speech can create habits of mind that affect more than merely the knowledge of language itself. We saw examples from three areas of language: spatial coordinates and their consequences for memory patterns and orientation, grammatical gender and its impact on associations, and the concepts of color, which can increase our sensitivity to certain color distinctions.
* When one hears about acts of extraordinary bravery in combat, it is usually a sign that the battle has not been going terribly well. For when wars unfold according to plan and one’s own side is winning, acts of exceptional individual heroism are rarely called for. Bravery is required mostly by the desperate side.

What Is Populism?
*****************

*Jan-Werner Muller*  (4294969672)

* in the end, populism actually be “the authentic voice of democracy,”
* In addition to being antielitist, populists are always antipluralist.
* Populists claim that they, and they alone, represent the people.
* populism is always a form of identity politics (though not all versions of identity politics are populist).
* illiberal democratic response to undemocratic liberalism.
* Populism, according to Arditi, resembles a drunken guest at a dinner party: he’s not respecting table manners, he is rude,
* he might even start “flirting with the wives of other guest
* t he might also be blurting out the truth about a liberal democracy that has become forgetful about its founding ideal of popular sovereignty.
* As is well known, “liberal” means something like “Social Democratic” in North America,
* economically successful citizens often adopt an essentially Social Darwinist attitude
* but they are also not “just emotions” in the sense of being completely divorced from thought.
* There are reasons for anger and frustration, which most people can actually spell out in some form or other.2
* to shift the discussion to social psychology (and treat the angry and frustrated as potential patients for a political sanatorium) is to neglect a basic democratic duty
* they considered to be “populism” as a helpless articulation of anxieties and anger by those longing for a simpler, “premodern” life.
* Nietzsche taught us, only that which has no history can be defined.
* This is the core claim of populism: only some of the people are really the people
* fighting for the interests of the plebs, “the common people,” is not populism
* but saying that only the plebs (as opposed to the patrician class, never mind the slaves) is the populus Romanus—and that only a particular kind of populares properly represents the authentic people—i
* Populists pit the pure, innocent, always hardworking people against a corrupt elite who do not really work
* If the populist politician fails at the polls, it is not because he or she does not represent the people, but because the majority has not yet dared to speak.
* if we really believed that all citizens were equal, we would employ lotteries to fill offices, just as was the case in ancient Athens)
* Hence it is a pious hope for liberals to think that all they have to do is expose corruption to discredit populists.
* And that leads to a final great irony
* Populism in power brings about, reinforces, or offers another variety of the very exclusion and the usurpation of the state that it most opposes in the reigning establishment it seeks to replace.12
* Officially abolishing or at least suspending democracy comes with enormous loss of international reputation (and possibly loss of international material support
* In the heady days when Communism fell and the world seemed drunk on democracy, it appeared that majority rule and the rule of law would always go neatly together.
* they’re not committed to it because they feel that democracy, packed in neoliberal wrapping, is not committed to them.”
* most important, “populism” serves as a very imprecise placeholder for “civic participation” or “social mobilization”
* Anyone can criticize existing procedures, fault them for moral blind spots,
* What is problematic is not the claim that present arrangements have failed
* but the claim that the critic and only the critic can speak for “the people
* populism is strong in places with weak party systems

Before World War II it had been given intellectual ballast by a group of mathematicians, logicians, and philosophers from the Austrian capital. They were known as the Vienna Circle.

Either it must be true in virtue of the meaning of its terms (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4 or “All trains are vehicles”), or it must be in principle verifiable through experimentation (e.g., “the moon is made of cheese,” or “five men ahead are roped to the track”).

Kant believed the Categorical Imperative could be derived through the exercise of our reason alone. The relevant version of his Categorical Imperative—the second formulation—asserts that we should always treat others “never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.”

He called it the “felicific calculus.” How much pleasure would it give you to eat that piece of chocolate cake in front of you, how long would this pleasure last, would it be accompanied by any unpleasant feelings (make you feel a bit nauseous?). In fact, Bentham identified seven relevant components of a pleasurable action: the pleasure’s intensity, duration, likelihood, propinquity (how quickly would the pleasure kick in), fecundity (would it produce similar sensations), purity (might it be followed by painful sensations), and extent (how many people would it affect). He regarded individuals as cargo containers of emotion: they should have a minimum of pain and be as jam-packed as possible with pleasure.

William B. Irvine - A Slap in the Face: Why Insults Hurt
********************************************************

*William B. Irvine*  (4294969550)

* Humans are pretty clever for a carbon-based life form.
* attributed to Oscar Wilde, that “a gentleman never insults anyone unintentionally
* one of the highest forms of praise is to emulate someone.
* sarcastic praise can inflict far more pain than ordinary insults can.
* Because of their pain-causing potential, insults can be enormously destructive to human relationships: a ten-word insult can, in under ten seconds, destroy a relationship that has lasted ten years. Why should this be? Why are insults so potent? In this chapter and the two that follow, I will try to answer these questions.
* We are all many things, but we pick out some of the things we are as being our defining characteristics
* Having a self-image helps us sort out our priorities and thereby helps us determine what, in the course of a day, we ought to do.
* part of the reason insults are painful is because they challenge our self-image.
* Here is an experiment for readers to try: the next time someone insults you, ask, “Why did you say that?” It is a response that is likely to stop the insulter in his tracks. It is also likely to lessen the chances that he will insult you again in the future. Most people, after all, will go to great lengths to avoid self-examination.
* We might respond to this insult simply by saying, “Thanks.” It is a response calculated to baffle the insulter: we did not fight back, as she had both hoped and expected; nor did the insult seem to give us any pain.
* Let us consider one final and, some would say, ultimately dismissive reply. Suppose, once again, that someone calls us a blathering idiot and we respond by saying, “What makes you think I care what you think about me
* Wrongs are often forgiven, but contempt never is. Our pride remembers it forever
* In the absence of a code of politeness, what counts as insulting behavior is subjective: insults will be in the mind of the beholder
* “Manners aim to facilitate life
* Ironically, codes of politeness, besides telling us how to avoid insulting others, provide us with a blueprint of what, exactly, we should do if our goal is to insult them
* we should not make the mistake of thinking that anyone who supports politeness codes also supports the PC code, or conversely.
* MOST PEOPLE ARE UNHAPPY, the Stoics reasoned, because they have chosen the wrong values by which to live. In particular, they are unhappy because they value fame and fortune.
* Insults hurt so much because they are reminders that our social standing is not as high as we would like it to be.
* IT IS UNUSUAL FOR PEOPLE to acquire their values through a process of careful reflection. Instead, they tend to take the easy way out and adopt whatever values those around them have adopted. And how did those around them choose their values? Probably by listening to their evolutionary programming. It rewards them for doing some things—having sex, for example, or gaining social status—and punishes them for doing other things. But this evolutionary programming, as we have seen, is not concerned with their having a happy and meaningful life; it is instead concerned with encouraging them to do things that, on the savannas of Africa 100,000 years ago, would have increased their chances of surviving and reproducing.
* if there is one thing people hate even worse than thinking, it is rethinking!
* if people think you amount to something, distrust yourself.
* those who do not know what is really good and what is really shameful, and who are overly concerned with their own fame—these people think that they are being injured if someone glares at them, laughs at them, hits them, or mocks them.
* An insult can cause us pain, say the Stoics, only if we believe it has harmed us: “Remember,” says Epictetus, “that what is insulting is not the person who abuses you or hits you, but the judgment about them that they are insulting.”4 He adds that “another person will not do you harm unless you wish it; you will be harmed at just that time at which you take yourself to be harmed.”5 But if we choose the proper values, an insult cannot do us any real harm. In particular, an insult cannot turn a person who is good, in the Stoic sense of the word, into a person who is bad. Keeping this in mind, the Stoics think, can deprive insults of their sting.
* the Stoics think we are foolish to spend our days, as many people do, trying to control things over which we have little or no control. Do this, and we are bound to become deeply frustrated
* To better understand the Stoics’ value system, consider the following question: would you rather have people think you are a good person when in fact you are a bad person, or think you are a bad person when in fact you are a good person? If you choose the first alternative—as I suspect most people will, albeit after some hemming and hawing—it is dramatic evidence of the extent to which you value fame. The Stoics, however, will unhesitatingly favor the second alternative: it is far better, they will insist, to be a good person and have people think you are bad than to be a bad person and have people think you are good. They would add that if you are a bad person, you are likely to have a bad life, no matter how highly others think of you, and that if you are a good person, you are likely to have a good life, no matter how poorly others think of you.
* Under these circumstances, the pacifist is well advised simply to sit back and watch the show
* The problem is that we humans are evolutionarily programmed to be insatiable:
* life is simply too short for us to spend it fretting over other people’s petty jabs.
* anger seems to be a self-fueling emotion: to vent it is to feed it.
* In retrospect, it was foolish for me to think that in part of one lifetime I could undo a few billion years of evolution
* Require not from me that I should be equal to the best, but that I should be better than the wicked.

Ethics: A Beginner's Guide (Beginner's Guides)
**********************************************

*Peter Cave*  (4294969116)

* Philosophy, it has been said, is thinking in slow motion
* The legal and the moral can overlap
* Non-calculative loving relationships are usually part of people’s happiness
* Best rules are determined by the ‘what if everyone…’ test
* Killing an innocent man is wrong – full stop. It is wrong even if, through my not killing this innocent man, many innocent individuals are killed by others; that immorality belongs to the others. Their immorality does not taint me. If ‘do not kill’ is indeed one moral duty, then Jim (recall ‘Jim and the Indians’) ought not to kill, even though the outcome is bad, with Pedro killing the twenty captive Indians. Jim’s hands are morally clean, despite the known consequences, despite him, in a sense, letting the twenty die. Some fancy footwork or casuistry – some subtle reasoning intended to rationalize or perhaps mislead – is needed here to ensure that there is a morally relevant distinction between killing and letting die. Had he taken up the offer to shoot a captive, he would have intended a death; in declining the offer, he intended no deaths, though he foresaw twenty. He is not to blame for the happenings that he foresaw (please see ‘double effect’). Of course, that does not help the twenty doomed captives.
* A classic example is that of ‘whom to save?’ A woman is able to save only one individual from drowning, yet two individuals are in the water, one her husband, the other unknown. Would the woman be guilty of prejudice, of marriage-ism, of love-ism, in choosing automatically to save her husband?
* Morality and personal happiness are entwined
* if you deliberately seek happiness you are unlikely to find it.
* Ask yourself whether you are happy,’ noted Mill, ‘and you cease to be so.’
* In speaking of desiring happiness, we are not challenging the common observation – from philosophers to therapists to gurus – that if you deliberately seek happiness you are unlikely to find it. ‘Ask yourself whether you are happy,’ noted Mill, ‘and you cease to be so.’ We need to aim at things we value: piano-playing, weaving, reading the whole of Proust, cooking for friends. In aiming, even if not achieving, we may be happy – as later discovered, when looking back. There are nuances: we sometimes feel happier at the expectation of achievements than at the achievements; ’tis better to travel than to arrive. We sometimes place more value on possessing desires than on their satisfaction or quelling; witness some instances of sexual desire. We may prefer certain desires not to arise; witness again some sexual desires or those yearnings for yet more chocolates.
* ’tis better to travel than to arrive. We sometimes place more value on possessing desires than on their satisfaction or quelling;
* One swallow does not make a spring
* Some reasons for developing a character trait undermine that trait: courageous individuals fail to be truly courageous if the character trait was developed solely for achieving glory, promotion or a few medals
* virtue of courage lies between a cowardly disposition to run away and a foolish disposition to be reckless.
* Goodness, not its appearance, says Plato, is essential to the flourishing life.
* In the US, it was not until 1964, with the growing Civil Rights movement, that racial segregation, with assumptions of white supremacy, was finally outlawed
* items, if unforced, naturally behave as if with ends ‘being sought’.
* We are using ‘good’ attributively: to tell whether something is a good X, we need to know what it is for; the ‘good’ is not free-standing, but tied to the ‘X’.

The Origins of Unhappiness: A New Understanding of Personal Distress
********************************************************************

*David Smail*  (4294969671)

* some people, who, so far as I can see, tend to equate a lack of answers with ‘pessimism’ or even ‘depression
* it seems to me only sensible.
* if you wish to consult one of their followers, you would be wise to enter the booth which seems most congenial to you.
* It is this paradigm of help – deliverance through a personal relationship –
* Despite there being an extremely wide range of theoretical ideas and practical procedures, many of them markedly incompatible with each other, there are nevertheless some general features which almost all approaches to therapy and counselling have in common. The most obvious of these is that the explanation and treatment of psychological distress are negotiated through the social transactions of two people: the ‘patient’ and the ‘therapist’. It seems almost so self-evident as to be beyond question that if you are suffering for reasons you can't immediately understand and rectify, you are best advised to consult an expert who will be able both to explain your difficulties and to offer an appropriate remedy for them. If in trouble, it seems indisputable that one's only recourse is to someone who can help, and if relatives and friends have been, as they so often are, unable even after their best efforts significantly to ease your pain, then a person must be sought who possesses the necessary knowledge and expertise to do the trick; there is scarcely any other way one could conceive of the trick being done. It is this paradigm of help – deliverance through a personal relationship – that underlies and legitimates the role of the counsellor, the priest, the physician, sorcerer and astrologer.
* Very often the need for solidarity with a person who is perceived as possessing power in relation to the individual's predicament outweighs any rational assessment of how effective that power actually is. Magic flourishes at the turn of the twentieth century no less vigorously than it did during the seventeenth. People still consult healers and astrologers, fortune-tellers and spiritualists in the confident belief that they possess effective powers of explanation and cure, and medicine itself is replete with procedures and practices for which there is no scientifically demonstrable justification. There is a great deal of comfort to be gained from association with someone who is able to convince you that s/he knows what s/he is doing, even if s/he doesn't.
* Lots of things can be comforting without being scientific – love, for instance.
* Hypocrisy gets in the way of clear understanding:
* none of us is free from the pressures which lead us to justify our practices in accordance with our enterprise
* and ‘truth’ cannot be totally detached from interest.
* For the problem psychologists and psychotherapists are addressing is not really a technical one of how to cure an illness or adjust an abnormality, but how to live a life, and that is simply not a closed question of the kind which can expect a simple answer. For example, whether feeling better is or isn't preferable to behaving better is not a technical, but an ethical issue, and there is no court – scientific or otherwise – in which it can be professionally decided. It is therefore possible to go on practising any kind of treatment, since any kind of outcome will be arguably ‘right’ (and, of course, equally arguably ‘wrong’). Unless ‘therapy’ or ‘treatment’ has absolutely no outcome at all, which it would surely be absurd to maintain, it is likely that in a preponderance of cases (those in which no obvious damage has been done) it will be perfectly possible to point to effects which are arguably beneficial.
* there is no court – scientific or otherwise – in which it can be professionally decided
* credibility on the grounds of the plausibility or impressiveness of its procedures rather than on the achievement of concrete results
* It would take an optimist of outstanding proportions to expect a mere book to make any difference to this state of affairs
* ‘Decency’ might almost be defined as the ability to shroud the nakedness of our interest
* Some of the most difficult and puzzling features of psychological distress belong to the time before we could talk
* The whole of our early experience is acquired in a state of ‘littleness’ through which most of us come to accept without question – even without noticing it
* The child cowers under the demands of such power as under the vengeful eye of a jealous and implacable god.
* Power exacts respect and ‘loyalty’ towards whatever it presents as its central demand
* We often overlook, I think, the close relationship of love to power
* uncomfortable as it might be to suggest it, our learning to love contains a strong element of choiceless dependence
* Blame can only give way to compassion if an unusually asymmetrical power structure is established between the people concerned
* It is the relative obscurity of the historical origins of people's experience which makes their subsequent difficulties often initially so puzzling. Problems which seem at face value to permit of quite simple solutions – perhaps through the almost minimal application of a bit of ‘will power’ – may seem almost maddeningly resistant to ‘treatment’ until one begins to see that they have foundations back at a time when the person was in no position to understand or grasp critically what was happening to him or her. Almost none of our experiences are defined just by the present, and, more than naive, it is simply false to assume (as does the idea of ‘transference’) that knowledge of the dimensions of the present alone is sufficient to spell out a rational account of our conduct.
* more than naive, it is simply false to assume (as does the idea of ‘transference’) that knowledge of the dimensions of the present alone is sufficient to spell out a rational account of our conduct.
* The power horizon of ordinary people is set not only by the limits of their own sphere of operations,
* but by the ability of the more powerful to screen their own interests and activities behind veils of ‘disinformation’, strategically constructed silence, and manipulation of the machinery of knowledge, enquiry and what counts as truth

Are You Smart Enough to Work at Google?

*William Poundstone*  (4294969531)

* over half of Google’s revenue now comes from ideas that began as 20 percent time projects
* The deep, dark secret of human resources is that job interviews don’t work. This isn’t exactly breaking news
* As a human resources concept, creativity is a legacy of the Sputnik-haunted Cold War epoch. The 1957 launch of the Soviet Union’s globe-girdling satellite shocked Americans out of complacency. I
* We all know roughly what “intelligence” means. It’s the ability to reason well and grasp the subtleties of the world around us
* It’s easy to believe that there are elements of truth to both the “nothing special” and disjoint hypotheses. Torrance favored a middle position, the threshold hypothesis. This says that you have to be intelligent in order to be creative—but the opposite isn’t the case. If you look at a random sample of creative, successful people, you will find that virtually 100 percent of them are highly intelligent. But if you look at a random sample of highly intelligent people, you’ll find that few of them are creative or conspicuously successful in business or life. Put another way, Mensa meetings are filled with smart losers.
* slough with a few tufts of good footing
* Today’s psychologists usually define creativity as the ability to combine novelty and usefulness in a particular social context.
* That’s how it fits into this puzzle. Because the digits of e never repeat, you can expect to find any sequence of digits in e if you look long enough. Your phone number is in e, somewhere. So is everyone else’s phone number, credit score, and batting average. The world’s population, tomorrow’s winning lotto numbers, and the current temperature in Tangier are all in there.
* If there’s a company that’s even cooler than Google, it’s Apple. The problem with getting hired at Apple is “the amount of people that would cut off their own testicle for a job,” one applicant reported. He was applying for a position at an Apple store opening in Florida—as a salesperson earning about eleven dollars an hour. He didn’t count on the Church of Apple:
* It’s not hard to understand why companies do this. The mystery is why so many job seekers are mesmerized by corporate mystiques.
* Why? Robert Levering and Milton Moskowitz, the authors of Fortune’s annual lists, have long argued that the crucial ingredient to their best workplaces is trust. It’s no secret that we live in a cynical age. How much time at a typical company is spent joking about the boss? More work gets done at those rare businesses where people care about the product, their superiors, and the company itself.
* Smart people go where smart people are, which enables them to launch cool stuff, which attracts more attention, and suddenly you have a feedback loop

* Google uses Bayesian filtering the way Microsoft uses the ‘if’ statement,
* Google also uses full-text-search-of-the-entire-Internet the way Microsoft uses little tables that list what error IDs correspond to which help text.
* Look at how Google does spell checking: it’s not based on dictionaries; it’s based on word usage statistics of the entire Internet, which is why Google knows how to correct my name, misspelled, and Microsoft Word doesn’t.
* This question tests something rarer than education—the capacity to ignore what you learned when it isn’t helpful
* There is an overwhelming temptation to use whatever intellectual tools are at hand and to pat yourself on the back for using the highest-powered tool possible.
* An engineer can’t help falling in love with the clever ideas and algorithms that have gone into a new product
* John Maynard Keynes said, in the long run, we’re all dead.
* One of the oft-cited mysteries of creativity is that revolutionary ideas often come from nonexperts with an outsider’s perspective
* Fermi staunchly believed that anyone with a PhD in physics should be able to estimate just about anything
* The Los Alamos crowd might have had trouble with that ethical equation. Fermi, at any rate, believed in the interconnectedness of knowledge. It was his observation that someone with a critical mass of facts and figures could use that to estimate very exotic things, like the number of light-years to the nearest alien civilization. These questions are therefore about charting a reasonably direct path from facts you know to the weird statistic demanded. That means you have to know some facts and be able to draw connections. You can round the math, but you shouldn’t pull numbers completely out of the air.

* Efficientare, it’s appropriate to ask the interviewer. Another piece of advice that’s often useful with these questions: start simple. When the question mentions a large number (like 100 floors), consider how you’d tackle the simplest cases (a 1-story building, a 2-story duplex, etc.). The answer is usually obvious. Then work your way up to larger values. A pattern will often emerge that you can extend.

A Few Lessons from Sherlock Holmes
**********************************

*Peter Bevlin*  (4294968581)

* Our divisions into sciences are not a part of nature...in nature there is really neither chemistry nor physics, nor zoology, nor physiology, nor pathology; there are only bodies to be classified or phenomena to be known and mastered
* I consider that a man’s brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it.
* But knowledge doesn’t automatically make us wise - the most learned are not the wisest
* Sorrow is often wisdom’s companion but it is better to learn from others sorrow to prevent our own
* Practice is a good instructor and teaches us to where to look and what to look for
* Education never ends, Watson. It is a series of lessons with the greatest for the last
* Diseases must be diagnosed before they can be cured. And if the diagnosis is wrong, the prescription will be wrong
* It is not to be imagined that he should know the remedies of diseases who knows not their original causes.
* No one can give rules for methods of thinking but it is possible to carry certain principles into operation. One is to strive to be delivered from hasty judgments. “Men see a little, presume a good deal, and so jump to the conclusion.” How common this is needs only a little study of our mental processes. In some this is a habit, in others a fault of education. (Thomas McCrae; The Method of Zadig)
* It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts
* Being nice is hardly the evidence of innocence
* Observation - Start with collecting facts and follow them where they lead
* More is missed by not looking than not knowing.
* For one mistake made for not knowing, ten mistakes are made for not looking.
* And don’t blindly collect endless amounts of facts
* Without an idea of how reality works, a purpose, provisional idea of what is important and what to look for, our observation or collection of facts is of little use
* One forms provisional theories and waits for time or fuller knowledge to explore them
* If falsehood, like truth, had only one face, we would be in better shape. For we would take as certain the opposite of what the liar said. But the reverse of truth has a hundred thousand shapes and a limitless field
* There may be many theories that fit the facts
* Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing...It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different
* wise man sees as much as he ought, not as much as he can
* More information isn’t necessarily better information but it may falsely increase our confidence - What is not worth knowing is not worth knowing
* The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance
* The value of experience is not in seeing much, but in seeing wisely
* ecklist” routines for critical factors help - assuming I am competent enough to decide what factors are critical and that I can evaluate them

* Programmers call these accretions “layers of abstraction,” because each time a new one is added, something complex and specific is being translated into something simpler and more general. The word abstraction comes from the Latin for draw away; here’s one computer science definition of the term: “The process of combining multiple smaller operations into a single unit that can be referred to by name.” Abstraction begins in the nursery. It is what children learn when they realize that if they want an apple, they don’t have to find one to point to but can simply say the word that refers to it. They also learn that abstraction depends on a common language, on shared assumptions of what class of objects the word apple refers to.

Insanely Simple
***************

*Ken Segall*  (4294967626)

* Blunt is Simplicity. Meandering is Complexity.
* To settle for second best is a violation of the rules of Simplicity, and it plants the seeds for disappointment, extra work, and more meetings. Most disturbing, it puts you in the worst possible business position: having to defend an idea you never believed in.
* Simplicity’s most important rules: Start with small groups of smart people—and keep them small. Every time the body count goes higher, you’re simply inviting Complexity to take a seat at the table
* Most people know from experience that the fastest way to lose focus, squander valuable time, and water down great ideas is to entrust them to a larger group.
* means you don’t have a lot of confidence in the group you started with. Whatever your motivation, what you’re really saying is that you don’t have the right people on the job. So fix that. When populated by the smartest people, small groups will give management more confidence, not less.
* The quality of work resulting from a project is inversely proportional to the number of people involved in the project.
* The quality of work resulting from a project increases in direct proportion to the degree of involvement by the ultimate decision maker.
* Remember, Simplicity is an all-or-none proposition. No picking and choosing allowed. If you can only muster up the energy to buy into part of it, you’re just going to hurt yourself trying.
* This is the problem that most big companies face. Their processes have become so institutionalized, they’re incapable of altering their own behavior—even if the benefits of change are staring them right in the face.

Design Patterns
***************

*Erich Gamma*  (4294967780)

* The design patterns in this book are descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context.
* Experienced object-oriented designers will tell you that a reusable and flexible design is difficult if not impossible to get “right” the first time.
* The design pattern identifies the participating classes and instances, their roles and collaborations, and the distribution of responsibilities.
* Every operation declared by an object specifies the operation’s name, the objects it takes as parameters, and the operation’s return value. This is known as the operation’s signature. The set of all signatures defined by an object’s operations is called the interface to the object. An object’s interface characterizes the complete set of requests that can be sent to the object. Any request that matches a signature in the object’s interface may be sent to the object.
* A mixin class is a class that’s intended to provide an optional interface or functionality to other classes. It’s similar to an abstract class in that it’s not intended to be instantiated. Mixin classes require multiple inheritance:
* In contrast, an object’s type only refers to its interface—
* Don’t declare variables to be instances of particular concrete classes. Instead, commit only to an interface defined by an abstract class
* Creational patterns ensure that your system is written in terms of interfaces, not implementations.
* The two most common techniques for reusing functionality in object-oriented systems are class inheritance and object composition. As we’ve explained, class inheritance lets you define the implementation of one class in terms of another’s. Reuse by subclassing is often referred to as white-box reuse. The term “white-box” refers to visibility: With inheritance, the internals of parent classes are often visible to subclasses.
* Because inheritance exposes a subclass to details of its parent’s implementation, it’s often said that “inheritance breaks encapsulation”
* Favor object composition over class inheritance.
* Dynamic, highly parameterized software is harder to understand than more static software.
* Delegation is a good design choice only when it simplifies more than it complicates
* The key to maximizing reuse lies in anticipating new requirements and changes to existing requirements, and in designing your systems so that they can evolve accordingly.
* Classes that are tightly coupled are hard to reuse in isolation, since they depend on each other. Tight coupling leads to monolithic systems, where you can’t change or remove a class without understanding and changing many other classes. The system becomes a dense mass that’s hard to learn, port, and maintain.
* Extending a class in isolation is easier if the class doesn’t depend on lots of other classes.
* If applications are hard to design, and toolkits are harder, then frameworks are hardest of all
* Design patterns should not be applied indiscriminately. Often they achieve flexibility and variability by introducing additional levels of indirection, and that can complicate
* emphasis shifts away from hard-coding a fixed set of behaviors toward defining a smaller set of fundamental behaviors that can be composed into any number of more complex ones
* the creational patterns give you a lot of flexibility in what gets created, who creates it, how it gets created, and when
* Class Diagram
* the biggest barrier to change lies in hard-coding the classes that get instantiated. The creational patterns provide different ways to remove explicit references to concrete classes from code that needs to instantiate them:
* Use the Abstract Factory pattern when•  a system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.•  a system should be configured with one of multiple families of pr

Good Math (for Jan S Morrison)
******************************

*Mark C. Chu-Carroll*  (4294968401)

* cardinals count objects; ordinals position them.
* And ultimately, the meanings of those numbers come down to   either quantity or position.
* Logic is a name for the general family of formal proof systems with inference rules.
* A logic is a system for mechanical reasoning
* Logic can’t be biased toward one side of an argument,     because logic neither knows nor cares what the argument means!
* until you could explain something to someone else,   you didn’t really understand it yourself
* Gregory      Chaitin (
* If you consider meaning, it’s easy to let your intuitive understanding sway you.
* If you know what the argument is about, it’s easy to let your own biases creep in
* Formally, a logic consists of three parts: syntax,     semantics,  and a set of inference rules
* Semantics tells what statements in the logic mean     by showing you how to move between the abstract symbolic statements     of the logic and the ideas and objects that you’re reasoning about
* A predicate is sort of like a function that describes     properties of objects or relationships between objects
* A predicate with its parameters filled in is called     either a     ​ simple fact​     or a     ​ simple statement​    .
* An existential lets us say that there must be a value     that makes a statement true,     even if we don’t know exactly what that statement is.
* Propositional logic is, basically, FOPL (first-order predicate logic)         where the predicates can’t         take parameters.
* predicates are the things that we use to reason about objects.
* A ​predicate​ is a statement that says something about some object or objects.     We’ll write predicates as either uppercase letters or as words starting with an uppercase letter     (​A​, ​B​, ​Married​),     and we’ll write objects in quotes.     Every predicate is followed by a list of comma-separated objects (or variables representing objects).
* One very important restriction is that ​predicates are not objects​.     That’s why this is called     ​ first-order​     predicate logic:     you can’t use a predicate to make a statement about another predicate.     So you can’t say something like ​Transitive(GreaterThan)​:     that’s a second-order statement,     which isn’t expressible in first-order logic.
* Incompletness proved that any formal system powerful enough to express Peano arithmetic     would be either incomplete or inconsistent
* The Turing machine is a mathematical model not of computers   but of ​computation​.   That’s a really important distinction.   The Turing machine is an easy-to-understand model of a computing device.   It’s definitely not the simplest model.   There are simpler computing devices   (for example, there’s a cellular automaton called rule 111 that is dramatically simpler),   but their simplicity makes them harder to understand.   The Turing machine strikes a balance between simplicity and comprehensibility that is,   at least in my opinion, completely unequalled.
* The capability of a Turing machine can be matched,   but never exceeded.   If a computing device can do the same computations as   a Turing machine, then it can do everything that any computer   can do.
* But despite their complexity   and despite our expectations,   computing devices are, in theory at least,   extremely simple machines.   What’s complicated is figuring out how to make them small and fast,   how to make them easy to program, or   how to build them so that they can interact with lots of devices.   But in fact, the basics of computation are so simple that you have to work hard to   build a computing system that ​isn’t​ Turing complete.

Code Simplicity
***************

*Max Kanat-Alexander*  (4294967519)

* However, this does not mean that design is a democracy. You     must not design by committee—the result will be an     actively bad design. Instead, all developers should have the authority to     make good design decisions in their own areas. If they make poor or     mediocre decisions, these should be overridden by a senior developer or     the lead programmer, who should have veto power over the designers below     them.[1] But otherwise, responsibility for the design of code should     rest with the people who are actually working     on it.
* any given decision     must be made by an individual, not by a group of people
* People who cannot conceive of helping another person will write bad   software—that is, their software won’t help people very much. In fact, it   might be theorized (as a guess, based on observation of many programmers   over time) that your potential ability to write good   software is limited only by your ability to conceive of helping   another.
* It is more important to reduce the           effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of           implementation.
* Don’t write code until you actually need           it, and remove any code that isn’t being used.
* In general, when your design makes things more complex       instead of simplifying things, you’re overengineering. That       orbital laser would hugely complicate the life of a person who just       needed to destroy some anthills, whereas some simple ant poison would       greatly simplify that person’s life by removing the ant problem       (assuming it worked).

The C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition
********************************************

*Bjarne Stroustrup*  (4294967798)

* Language shapes the way we think, and determines what we can think about
* Hurry Slowly (festina lente).
* A piece of advice should be applied only where reasonable.
* There is no substitute for intelligence, experience, common sense, and good taste.
* The first thing we do, let’s kill all the language lawyers.– Henry VI, Part II
* A declaration is a statement that introduces a name into the program. It specifies a type for the named entity:
* C++ offers a variety of notations for expressing initialization, such as the = used above, and a universal form based on curly-brace-delimited initializer lists:
* When defining a variable, you don’t actually need to state its type explicitly when it can be deduced from the initializer
* Using auto, we avoid redundancy and writing long type name
* • constexpr: meaning roughly “to be evaluated at compile time” (§10.4). This is used primarily to specify constants, to allow placement of data in memory where it is unlikely to be corrupted, and for performance.
* • const: meaning roughly “I promise not to change this value” (§7.5). This is used primarily to specify interfaces, so that data can be passed to functions without fear of it being modified. The compiler enforces the promise made by const.
* For a function to be usable in a constant expression, that is, in an expression that will be evaluated by the compiler, it must be defined constexpr. For example:
* This for-statement can be read as “set i to zero; while i is not 10, copy the ith element and increment i.” When applied to an integer variable, the increment operator, ++, simply adds 1. C++ also offers a simpler for-statement, called a range-for-statement, for loops that traverse a sequence in the simplest way:
* The first range-for-statement can be read as “for every element of v, from the first to the last, place a copy in x and print it.” Note that we don’t have to specify an array bound when we initialize it with a list. The range-for-statement can be used for any sequence of elements (§3.4.1).
* We try to ensure that a pointer always points to an object, so that dereferencing it is valid. When we don’t have an object to point to or if we need to represent the notion of “no object available” (e.g., for an end of a list), we give the pointer the value nullptr (“the null pointer”). There is only one nullptr shared by all pointer types:
* The new operator allocates memory from an area called the free store (also known as dynamic memory and heap; §11.2).
* We use . (dot) to access struct members through a name (and through a reference) and –> to access struct members through a pointer. For example:
* Having the data specified separately from the operations on it has advantages, such as the ability to use the data in arbitrary ways. However, a tighter connection between the representation and the operations is needed for a user-defined type to have all the properties expected of a “real type
* Having the data specified separately from the operations on it has advantages, such as the ability to use the data in arbitrary ways. However, a tighter connection between the representation and the operations is needed for a user-defined type to have all the properties expected of a “real type.” In particular, we often want to keep the representation inaccessible to users, so as to ease use, guarantee consistent use of the data, and allow us to later improve the representation. To do that we have to distinguish between the interface to a type (to be used by all) and its implementation (which has access to the otherwise inaccessible data). The language mechanism for that is called a class. A class is defined to have a set of members, which can be data, function, or type members. The interface is defined by the public members of a class, and private members are accessible only through that interface. For example:
* The first and most important step is to distinguish between the interface to a part and its implementation
* Focus on programming techniques, not on language features

* Peace is not only better than war, but infinitely more arduous
* To say I am lucky to be alive doesn’t fully capture the extent to which I recognize this to be true, for as long as I can claim it to be. And hopefully, I’m not nearly done yet. Most of us come into this world amidst a frenzy of pain and emotion and unpredictability, and too many of us leave in the same way. If between the two certitudes of birth and death lies a generous period of love, family, and friendships, free from the shackles of violence and poverty, it is a life to be coveted. War, and the pursuit of war, destroys us. It turns teenagers into killers, neighbours into génocidaires, and politicians into executioners. War is humanity at its most primitive, despite our attempts to dress it up, distance ourselves from it through technology, and frame it in acceptable terms – a battle for good in the face of tyranny or despotism or fanaticism. In the end, all wars are only one thing: people killing people. This is not to suggest that there cannot be justifiable reasons for responding militarily to acts of aggression that destroy civilian lives. But war in and of itself is ruinous to civilians and must always remain a measure of last resort. It ought to be difficult and complex and governed by frustrating processes for achieving global consensus.
* During his first year in office, President Barack Obama authorized more attacks against suspected terrorists (habeas corpus notwithstanding) by unmanned drones flying over Pakistan than George W. Bush did in his entire presidency.
* the Attack of the Drones has also killed civilians, at a ratio of fifty to one.
* The last decade has witnessed an extraordinary if not devastating political appetite for war, made possible by a prevailing belief in its primacy in solving international threats. The rhetoric of “killing scumbags” in Afghanistan and elsewhere has perpetuated a kind of nationalistic fervour in which there is little room for thoughtful dissent, even as the human and financial costs of waging war reach levels that are wholly unsustainable. Annual military spending is now at the highest point since World War II (higher than during the Cold War), with the United States footing half the bill. During his first year in office, President Barack Obama authorized more attacks against suspected terrorists (habeas corpus notwithstanding) by unmanned drones flying over Pakistan than George W. Bush did in his entire presidency. In the process of hitting its targets of armed militants, the Attack of the Drones has also killed civilians, at a ratio of fifty to one. Names and locations of targets are also proposed by the mercurial government of Pakistan – a military serfdom under whose auspices Osama Bin Laden “hid” for years. No doubt there is some kind of process of intelligence-gathering in place to verify submissions for extrajudicial execution. But “military intelligence,” as Groucho Marx once cracked (before Bush rendered it prophecy), “is a contradiction in terms.”
* But “military intelligence,” as Groucho Marx once cracked (before Bush rendered it prophecy), “is a contradiction in terms.”
* The war in Afghanistan was a problem long before Al-Qaeda started redecorating the rocky mountain caves of northern Pakistan.
* Every war zone I have ever worked in has taught me something. Some of these experiences made me angry. Others made me laugh. Many reduced me to tears. And a few filled me with intense regret about the things I might have done differently. These experiences make me neither better nor worse than anyone else – just slightly more adrift, straddling chaos and misery on the one hand, and peace and privilege on the other. It seems odd to have found myself drawn to war zones over the years; to find emotional shelter in the way war reduces existential doubts down to simple truths about the will to survive. But war is surprisingly full of ironies. The chain-smoking nine-year-old rifling through luggage at a nondescript checkpoint in the bush, armed with a Kalashnikov rifle and demanding a copy of Harry Potter. The frustrated American soldier shouting, “Don’t you want freedom and democracy?” from the top of an armoured security vehicle at a bunch of misanthropic, rock-throwing street children in Karbala, Iraq. The Afghan women who remove their burqas and then proceed to have the kind of intimate conversations that would be too bold even for Sex and the City writers. The experience of war shatters all assumptions about who and what we are as human beings – the horrors we are capable of, our ignorance and prejudices, and our ability to show great compassion and courage in the face of extreme adversity. And perhaps this is war’s greatest irony: it offers the ultimate perspective on the sanctity of life.
* perhaps this is war’s greatest irony: it offers the ultimate perspective on the sanctity of life.
* There are certain rules about a war, and rule number one is that young men die. And rule number two is, doctors can’t change rule number one.
* myth of humanitarian aid as a noble response to an ignoble act.
* Fatalities from terrorist attacks increased by more than 250 percent in the five years after September 11, 2001, and remain disturbingly high.
* the black-market price of an assault rifle in a war-torn country averages less than the price of admission to an American theme park
* the unwillingness of many arms-producing countries to disclose information related to the sale or transfer of arms and munitions deliberately frustrates the task of holding governments accountable.
* Even Mikhail Kalashnikov has expressed regret that he did not invent a lawn mower instead.
* Peace, development, and security will remain stubbornly out of reach for any civilian population choking on weapons fed to them by countries with eighty times their GDP
* The extent of the weapons problem in Somalia thwarted every effort to contain the war and the suffering it caused. Even after an arms embargo was declared in 1992, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Yemen, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and others continued to ship arms to Somalia’s warring factions and religious zealots, who had unfettered access to aggrieved young men. NATO countries, in turn, readily sent arms to many of those on that list. During the 2010 World Cup, Somalia’s Islamo-fascist youth brigade, Al-Shabab (which has also managed to capture the imagination of young men from Somalia’s North American diaspora), succeeded in blowing up civilian targets in Uganda’s capital city, Kampala, killing seventy-six and seriously injuring dozens more. These young men have been raised by war and suckled by religious fanaticism. Al-Qaeda recognizes their disaffection as capital and deploys it strategically to provoke fear and wage war on its enemies. We are fighting the wrong battles while placing pathological bets on our own failures.
* We are fighting the wrong battles while placing pathological bets on our own failures.
* “We die for things we have never seen, never touched. On meurt pour rien.” We die for nothing.
* The war in the Congo has earned the regrettable distinction of being the worst war, in terms of the number of civilians killed, since World War II (and the worst in African history).
* For many Congolese, life has not improved much since Charles Marlow transported ivory for The Company in Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness more than a century ago. Perhaps the starkest difference is that the Congo’s wealth is no longer principally above ground, but rather within it: in its oleaginous rivers, clay soil, and volcanic rock, in the form of gold, diamonds, tin, copper, tungsten, cobalt, and columbite-tantalite (coltan, for short). Coltan is an ore that yields the metal tantalum, which is one of four minerals mined in eastern Congo used to make capacitors in electronic devices including cell phones, digital cameras, video game consoles, and computers. Between 60 and 80 percent of the world’s coltan deposits are in eastern Congo, where it is collected by hand. This resource is used in developed countries every day, yet most have no idea what it is or where it comes from.

The Office Politics Handbook
****************************

*Jack Godwin*  (4294968153)

* My hobby, my place in the birth order, and my personality prepared me, somehow, for an apprenticeship in political science. As the middle child, I received less attention, but I had the right temperament and a discreet vantage point from which to observe the political dynamics of daily family life. The first lesson: Never discuss politics or religion in mixed company. Politics and religion are notoriously disruptive and so charged with emotion that disagreement and hard feelings are inevitable.1 This equation—politics equals emotional tension—is why talking about politics is strictly forbidden at the dinner table.
* power will compensate for the subordination (or deprivation) of other values, which is how these individuals justify their power-seeking behavior
* Power is anything that facilitates control by one human over another. Power is the concept that distinguishes political science from all other social sciences. Without this concept, there would be no need for political science at all. What is politics? Politics is any social situation in which power is introduced. The essence of politics is self-interest, which is the most reliable standard to measure the success of political action. Other fields have their own standards, their own ways of measuring success, but nothing supersedes the autonomy of the political sphere.
* This idea of how-much-to (what I call political economy) is important because politics is about power, the acquisition of power, the distribution of power, and the uses and abuses of power. Politics can be horrifying, insulting, and cruel, but not necessarily violent. This is where the idea of how-much-to enters into the equation. Power is a useful instrument, but a blunt instrument for those who habitually rely on threats of punishment or promises of reward to force someone’s submission. The key to politics is to use only as much power as required, which is why you need to know about different types of power, how to use them, and, equally important, how to recognize them when someone else is using them against you.
* Politics is an interpersonal situation, which by definition requires at least two people interacting, taking cues from and responding to one another in an ongoing spiral of give and take.3
* Political animals are power-seekers whose success depends on convincing or neutralizing those who are resistant or indifferent. If there are power-seekers who minimize other goals in their lives for the sake of power, there are also power-yielders who relinquish power because they put a premium on other values.
* The Deficit Theory of Education. Here is Chadwick’s no-nonsense explanation: “Psychologists have weak egos, mathematicians can’t add, anthropologists don’t understand culture, sociologists are generally from ‘out groups,’ political scientists have power hang-ups, and so on. The deficit is something they value and see themselves as having less of than they want or need. Fear of not overcoming that deficit is their motivation
* You are a political animal, which means you can learn to separate physical pain from emotional pain, particularly the kind you suffer from indignation and insult
* The main concept of political realism is that politics is about power
* 3. Power is anything that facilitates the control of one human over another, and politics is any social relationship that serves this end.4 Although politics is about power, the meaning of power may change depending on time and place because people have different interests at different times. Interest is the essence of politics because interest is the most reliable standard by which we can judge political action. In politics, interest is synonymous with special interest, meaning a relationship exists between an individual or group and a specific privilege or financial benefit. In management, we call people “stakeholders” when they have a stake, an investment, or an interest in a project or organization, and can influence or be influenced by the project or organization’s activities. In politics, interests and special interest groups—the stakes and the stakeholders—are inseparable. No matter how virtuous people may be in public, very few people are capable of making long-term sacrifices contrary to their interests. This kind of behavior is simply inconsistent with human nature. This does not mean there are no examples of long-term sacrifice in human history, but it means you should not build your foundation on this false assumption. Because the laws of politics are impervious to our preferences, it is impossible to change the world either by confronting or ignoring these laws. Before you take political action, and before you define your specific interest in any situation, you should take this into account.
* the meaning of power may change depending on time and place because people have different interests at different times
* In politics, you must learn to separate political action from morality
* Harold Lasswell defined power as the threat of deprivation of something of value
* Max Weber defined power as “the probability that one actor within a social relationship will be in position to carry out his own will despite resistance, regardless of the basis on which this probability rests
* You may dismiss the idea that politics is deeply rooted in human nature, but you would only be deceiving yourself. You may disparage the role of power in society, but this would not alter human nature one iota. All humans share a set of attributes that define the normal range of feeling, thinking, and behaving. Just as a human mother can only give birth to a human baby, your feelings, thoughts, and behaviors form a perfectly accurate representation of human nature. The implication is that your educational and cultural background is a façade, a thin veneer that may change your emotional and behavioral repertoire, but does not in any way alter the range of attributes all humans share.
* Separately, these types have limited utility, but if you can develop the capacity to move along the spectrum toward the object or toward the idea, then you can increase your sense of objectivity
* Even so, each type has tendencies along with challenges that are common to it. Rather than point out the bias or subjectivity of your antagonist/coworker, for example, you should try to be aware of your own type. Self-awareness makes room for growth and thus precedes self-mastery. Self-awareness entails finding the balance (a flexible and elastic balance with a low center of gravity) between introversion and extroversion, between your relation to ideas and your relation to things.
* Extroverts have a habit of looking outside themselves for solutions when they could be looking inward
* . The idea is not to become dependent on one type of thinking, but to adopt the most politically useful aspects of each
* According to Plato, love of learning was the single most important characteristic of a true leader—and true leaders were as uncommon then as they are now. Those who disliked or had no predisposition for lifelong learning would lack the ability to tell right from wrong, and would have no way of judging a good idea from a bad one. Our cities and states (and our corporations and universities by extrapolation) would never come close to achieving their true potential, said Plato, until philosophers were kings and vice versa—meaning until political greatness came together with wisdom

David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants
*********************************************************************

*Malcolm Gladwell*  (4294968725)

* “I have so many coaches come in every year to learn the press,” Pitino said. He is now the head basketball coach at the University of Louisville, and Louisville has become the Mecca for all those Davids trying to learn how to beat Goliaths. “Then they e-mail me. They tell me they can’t do it. They don’t know if their players can last.” Pitino shook his head. “We practice every day for two hours,” he went on. “The players are moving almost ninety-eight percent of the practice. We spend very little time talking. When we make our corrections”—that is, when Pitino and his coaches stop play to give instructions—“they are seven-second corrections, so that our heart rate never rests. We are always working.” Seven seconds! The coaches who come to Louisville sit in the stands and watch that ceaseless activity and despair. To play by David’s rules you have to be desperate. You have to be so bad that you have no choice. Their teams are just good enough that they know it could never work. Their players could never be convinced to play that hard. They were not desperate enough. But Ranadivé? Oh, he was desperate. You would think, looking at his girls, that their complete inability to pass and dribble and shoot was their greatest disadvantage. But it wasn’t, was it? It was what made their winning strategy possible.
* He had no stake in the finer points of military ritual.
* In other words, if you are a student—particularly a poor student—what you need is to have people around you asking the same questions, wrestling with the same issues, and worrying about the same things as you are, so that you feel a little less isolated and a little more normal.
* The lesson of the Impressionists is that there are times and places where it is better to be a Big Fish in a Little Pond than a Little Fish in a Big Pond, where the apparent disadvantage of being an outsider in a marginal world turns out not to be a disadvantage at all
* Stouffer’s point is that we form our impressions not globally, by placing ourselves in the broadest possible context, but locally—by comparing ourselves to people “in the same boat as ourselves.” Our sense of how deprived we are is relative. This is one of those observations that is both obvious and (upon exploration) deeply profound, and it explains all kinds of otherwise puzzling observations. Which do you think, for example, has a higher suicide rate: countries whose citizens declare themselves to be very happy, such as Switzerland, Denmark, Iceland, the Netherlands, and Canada? or countries like Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, whose citizens describe themselves as not very happy at all? Answer: the so-called happy countries. It’s the same phenomenon as in the Military Police and the Air Corps. If you are depressed in a place where most people are pretty unhappy, you compare yourself to those around you and you don’t feel all that bad. But can you imagine how difficult it must be to be depressed in a country where everyone else has a big smile on their face?2
* Think about this for a moment. We have a group of high achievers at Hartwick. Let’s call them the Hartwick All-Stars. And we’ve got another group of lower achievers at Harvard. Let’s call them the Harvard Dregs. Each is studying the same textbooks and wrestling with the same concepts and trying to master the same problem sets in courses like advanced calculus and organic chemistry, and according to test scores, they are of roughly equal academic ability. But the overwhelming majority of Hartwick All-Stars get what they want and end up as engineers or biologists. Meanwhile, the Harvard Dregs—who go to the far more prestigious school—are so demoralized by their experience that many of them drop out of science entirely and transfer to some nonscience major. The Harvard Dregs are Little Fish in a Very Big and Scary Pond. The Hartwick All-Stars are Big Fish in a Very Welcoming Small Pond. What matters, in determining the likelihood of getting a science degree, is not just how smart you are. It’s how smart you feel relative to the other people in your classroom.
* the best students from mediocre schools were almost always a better bet than good students from the very best schools.
* So far in David and Goliath, we’ve looked at the ways in which we are often misled about the nature of advantages. Now it is time to turn our attention to the other side of the ledger. What do we mean when we call something a disadvantage? Conventional wisdom holds that a disadvantage is something that ought to be avoided—that it is a setback or a difficulty that leaves you worse off than you would be otherwise. But that is not always the case. In the next few chapters, I want to explore the idea that there are such things as “desirable difficulties.” That concept was conceived by Robert Bjork and Elizabeth Bjork, two psychologists at the University of California, Los Angeles, and it is a beautiful and haunting way of understanding how underdogs come to excel.
* A near miss leaves you traumatized. A remote miss makes you think you are invincible.

* “It has been said that most revolutions are not caused by revolutionaries in the first place, but by the stupidity and brutality of governments
* This is called the “principle of legitimacy,” and legitimacy is based on three things. First of all, the people who are asked to obey authority have to feel like they have a voice—that if they speak up, they will be heard. Second, the law has to be predictable. There has to be a reasonable expectation that the rules tomorrow are going to be roughly the same as the rules today. And third, the authority has to be fair. It can’t treat one group differently from another.
* And when the law is applied in the absence of legitimacy, it does not produce obedience. It produces the opposite. It leads to backlash.
* power has an important limitation. It has to be seen as legitimate, or else its use has the opposite of its intended effect.
* there comes a point where the best-intentioned application of power and authority begins to backfire
* The excessive use of force creates legitimacy problems, and force without legitimacy leads to defiance, not submission.

Essential German Grammar
************************

*Durrell, Martin; Kohl, Katrin; Loftus, Gudrun*  (4294969652)

* The grammar of a language is its basic framework which allows you to combine a finite number of words in an infinite number of ways – and still be understood immediately
* German seems to have ‘more grammar’ at the beginning because it’s an ‘inflecting’ language
* In German, the function of a noun phrase is not shown by its position, but by changing the endings of the determiner, adjective, noun or pronoun which make up the noun phrase:   Der   Junge küsst   das   Mädchen or   Die   Schlange frisst   den   Frosch. We can change the order of the words in the last sentence:   Den   Frosch frisst   die   Schlange, but it is still the frog which is being eaten and the snake doing the eating.
* DETERMINER, which is a handy cover term for the whole set of function words which typically come with a noun.
* VERBS  ,   NOUNS ,  PRONOUNS   and   ADJECTIVES   are familiar grammatical terms, but you may not have come across the word   DETERMINER  , which is a handy cover term for the whole set of function words which typically come with a noun. The most important determiners are the   ARTICLES   der and ein, the   DEMONSTRATIVES  , like dieser, the   POSSESSIVES  , like mein, and   INDEFINITES   like einige and viele.

Confessions of an Economic Hit Man
**********************************

*John Perkins*  (4294968997)

* It is driven not by a small band of men but by a concept that has become accepted as gospel: the idea that all economic growth benefits humankind and that the greater the growth, the more widespread the benefits. This belief also has a corollary: that those people who excel at stoking the fires of economic growth should be exalted and rewarded, while those born at the fringes are available for exploitation.
* When we equate the gluttonous consumption of the earth’s resources with a status approaching sainthood, when we teach our children to emulate people who live unbalanced lives, and when we define huge sections of the population as subservient to an elite minority, we ask for trouble. And we get it.
* Every opportunity is taken to convince us that purchasing things is our civic duty, that pillaging the earth is good for the economy and therefore serves our higher interests.
* Confessing a sin is the beginning of redemption
* I have come to understand that life is composed of a series of coincidences. How we react to these—how we exercise what some refer to as free will—is everything; the choices we make within the boundaries of the twists of fate determine who we are. Two major coincidences that shaped my life occurred at Middlebury. One came in the form of an Iranian, the son of a general who was a personal advisor to the shah; the other was a beautiful young woman named Ann, like my childhood sweetheart.
* growth of GNP may result even when it profits only one person, such as an individual who owns a utility company, and even if the majority of the population is burdened with debt. The rich get richer and the poor grow poorer. Yet, from a statistical standpoint, this is recorded as economic progress.
* The beautiful and the ugly, the elegant and the vulgar, the spiritual and the profane.
* in many cases helping an economy grow only makes those few people who sit atop the pyramid even richer, while it does nothing for those at the bottom except to push them even lower.
* Indeed, promoting capitalism often results in a system that resembles medieval feudal societies.
* Latin American history was littered with dead heroes.
* A system based on corrupting public figures does not take kindly to public figures who refuse to be corrupted.
* The deception was not in what was stated, but in what was omitted.
* When the debtors cannot pay, hit men move in to demand their pound of flesh. If this is not granted, the jackals close in with baseball bats. Finally, as a last resort, out come the guns.
* If I were not crazy for leaving, then they might have to consider their own sanity in staying. It was easier to see me as a person who had departed from his senses.
* During the 1980s and into the 1990s, the emphasis switched from entrepreneurship to deregulation
* What was going on in the energy field was symbolic of a trend that was affecting the whole world. Concerns about social welfare, the environment, and other quality-of-life issues took a backseat to greed. In the process, an overwhelming emphasis was placed on promoting private businesses. At first, this was justified on theoretical bases, including the idea that capitalism was superior to and would deter communism. Eventually, however, such justification was unneeded. It was simply accepted a priori that there was something inherently better about projects owned by wealthy investors rather than by governments. International organizations such as the World Bank bought into this notion, advocating deregulation and privatization of water and sewer systems, communications networks, utility grids, and other facilities that up until then had been managed by governments.
* journalists who thought the public needed heroes rather than objectivity.
* blocks in Charleston, Cartagena, and Havana. They simply recruit desperate people and build a factory to produce the jackets, blue jeans, tennis shoes, automobile parts, computer components, and thousands of other items they can sell in the markets of their choosing.

Cheap: The High Cost of Discount Culture
****************************************

*Ellen Ruppel Shell*  (4294969153)

* Over time, choice became restricted by price—what could not be sold cheaply, like the Chinese boots, became a de facto luxury, like the Italian boots.
* neuroscientists have discovered that the very anticipation of a “bargain” sets our neural networks aquiver
* Without China, there would be no Cheap
* The severe exploitation of China’s factory workers and the contraction of the American middle class are two sides of the same coin.
* Our pleasures are not material pleasures, but symbols of pleasure—attractively packaged but inferior in content
* These stores were free agents without loyalty to any particular community, and they held no loyalty to any particular supplier.
* Dignity was not a priority.
* . Almost overnight discounters reversed the venerable retailing practice of offering customers precisely what they wanted. Rather, discounters offered customers what was available at the lowest possible price and positioned these goods in such a way—both physically and psychologically—as to convince customers they were getting the very best dea
* The focus switched from the object to the deal: If the deal was good, the object under consideration became less critical to the transaction
* Gradually, America grew accustomed to the compromises embedded in low price and showed a growing willingness to trade cost for quality.
* “value” (often a thinly disguised euphemism for cheap)
* Carter found particularly noxious “a mistaken idea of freedom [as] the right to grasp for ourselves some advantage over others.
* Of the forty-two department store chains in operation in 1980, only twenty survived that decade.
* Harvard cultural historian Lizabeth Cohen has pointed out that mass-market consumption offers the façade of social equality without forcing society to go through the hard work of redistributing wealth. Low prices lead consumers to think they can get what they want without necessarily giving them what they want—or need. The ancient Roman phrase for this is panem et circenses, bread and circuses, the art of plying citizens with pleasures to distract them from pain. Today, low prices are the circus.
* Wal-Mart may not be great to its employees, but it is great to its investors

* How is it possible that without exploitation, criminality, or deception, a $8.98 dress could be designed, sewn from real cloth in India or China, packed in a shipping container, shipped thousands of miles, unloaded into a truck powered by diesel fuel, driven smack across the country, unpacked by human hands, hung on a hanger, and displayed for at least a day or two on a Manhattan shop floor? The answer to this question is that it is not possible or, for that matter, sustainabl

Second Thoughts of an Idle Fellow 
**********************************

*Jerome Klapka Jerome*  (4294967317)

* for the wages of freedom in this world are vermin and starvation
* We can live lives worth living only by placing the collar round our neck.
* To purchase luxury we have sold our ease.
* It irritates me to think how hard I work for no earthly benefit to myself.
* Why do we work merely to earn money to buy food; and eat food so as to gain strength that we may work?
* Why do we live, merely in the end to say good-bye to one another
* Will it matter, in the days when the glacial period shall have come again, to clothe the earth with silence, whose foot first trod the Pole
* And the seasons pass, bringing with them the sunshine and the rain, till the flower withers, never having known the real purpose for which it lived, thinking the garden was made for it, not it for the garden
* A laugh and a sigh, a kiss and good-bye, is our life. Is it worth so much fretting
* There is a mean between basking through life with the smiling contentment of the alligator, and shivering through it with the aggressive sensibility of the Lama determined to die at every cross word
* Yes, let us curse Fate by all means—some one to curse is always useful.
* It took a murdered father, a drowned sweetheart, a dishonoured mother, a ghost, and a slaughtered Prime Minister to produce the emotions in Hamlet that a modern minor poet obtains from a chorus girl's frown, or a temporary slump on the Stock Exchang
* The boatmen of Ulysses faced the thunder and the sunshine alike with frolic welcome. We modern sailors have grown more sensitive. The sunshine scorches us, the rain chills us. We meet both with loud self-pity.
* Our joke is generally another's pain. The man who sits down on the tin-tack rarely joins in the laugh
* We build our heaven of the stones of our desires: to the old, red-bearded Norseman, a foe to fight and a cup to drain; to the artistic Greek, a grove of animated statuary; to the Red Indian, his happy hunting ground; to the Turk, his harem; to the Jew, his New Jerusalem, paved with gold; to others, according to their taste, limited by the range of their imagination.
* To talk as an idiot when you ARE an idiot brings no discomfort;

The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window Into Human Nature
************************************************************

*Steven Pinker*  (4294968463)

* h “importance” is often hard to quantif
* Semantics is about the relation of words to thoughts, but it is also about the relation of words to other human concerns.
* Linguists call the inventory of concepts and the schemes that combine them “conceptual semantics.
* As we shall see, language is saturated with implicit metaphors like EVENTS ARE OBJECTS and TIME IS SPACE. Indeed, space turns out to be a conceptual vehicle not just for time but for many kinds of states and circumstances. Just as a meeting can be moved from 3:00 to 4:00, a traffic light can go from green to red, a person can go from flipping burgers to running a corporation, and the economy can go from bad to worse. Metaphor is so widespread in language that it’s hard to find expressions for abstract ideas that are not metaphorical. What does the concreteness of language say about human thought? Does it imply that even our wispiest concepts are represented in the mind as hunks of matter that we move around on a mental stage? Does it say that rival claims about the world can never be true or false but can only be alternative metaphors that frame a situation in different ways? Those are the obsessions of chapter 5.
* The trouble with the world is not that people know too little, but that they know so many things that aren’t so
* So what exactly does William Shakespeare mean, if not “great writer, author of Hamlet,” and so on? A name really has no definition in terms of other words, concepts, or pictures. Instead it points to an entity in the world, because at some instant in time the entity was dubbed with the name and the name stuck. William Shakespeare, then, points to the individual who was christened William by Mr. and Mrs. Shakespeare around the time he was born. The name is connected to that guy, whatever he went on to do, and however much or little we know about him. A name points to a person in the world in the same way that I can point to a rock in front of me right now. The name is meaningful to us because of an unbroken chain of word of mouth (or word of pen) that links the word we now use to the original act of christening. We will see that it’s not just names, but words for many kinds of things, that are rigidly yoked to the world by acts of pointing, dubbing, and sticking rather than being stipulated in a definition.
* language ensnares us in a self-contained web of symbols.
* Bertrand Russell in a 1950s radio interview: I am firm; you are obstinate; he is pigheaded
* In each triplet the literal meaning of the words is held constant, but the emotional meaning ranges from attractive to neutral to offensive
* It is a real puzzle for the science of mind why, when an unpleasant event befalls us—we slice our thumb along with the bagel, or knock a glass of beer into our lap—the topic of our conversation turns abruptly to sexuality, excretion, or religio
* Not only do we turn to certain words for sexuality, excretion, and religion when we are in an excitable state, but we are wary of such words when we are in any other state. Many epithets and imprecations are not just unpleasant but taboo: the very act of uttering them is an affront to listeners, even when the concepts have synonyms whose use is unexceptionable. The tendency of words to take on awesome powers may be found in the taboos and word magic in cultures all over the world. In Orthodox Judaism, the name of God, transcribed as YHVH and conventionally pronounced Yahweh, may never be spoken, except by high priests in the ancient temple on Yom Kippur in the “holy of holies,” the chamber housing the ark of the covenant. In everyday conversation observant Jews use a word to refer to the word, referring to God as hashem, “the name.”
* While taboo language is an affront to common sensibilities, the phenomenon of taboo language is an affront to common sense. Excretion is an activity that every incarnate being must engage in daily, yet all the English words for it are indecent, juvenile, or clinical. The elegant lexicon of Anglo-Saxon monosyllables that give the English language its rhythmic vigor turns up empty-handed just when it comes to an activity that no one can avoid. Also conspicuous by its absence is a polite transitive verb for sex—a word that would fit into the frame Adam verbed Eve or Eve verbed Adam. The simple transitive verbs for sexual relations are either obscene or disrespectful, and the most common ones are among the seven words you can’t say on television.
* psychology of word magic is not just a pathology of censorious bluenoses but a constituent of our emotional and linguistic makeup.
* Language is understood at multiple levels, rather than as a direct parse of the content of the sentence.
* As children learn their mother tongue, they, too, are solving an induction problem
* Language itself is not a single system but a contraption with many components
* t language acquisition is an example of the problem of induction—making valid generalizations about the future from limited data available in the presen

The Way of the Bow
******************

*Paulo Coelho*  (4294967542)

* Elegance is achieved when everything superfluous has been discarded,
* Intuition has nothing to do with routine, but with a state of mind that is beyond technique.So, after much practising, we no longer think about the necessary movements, they become part of our own existence. But for this to happen, you must practise and repeat
* The archer cannot always choose the battlefield, so start your training again and be prepared for unfavourable situation
* We should never judge people without first learning to hear and to respect them
* Therefore, before you begin anything, seek out your allies, people who are interested in what you are doing. I'm not saying 'seek out other archers
* It requires periods of inaction - a bow that is always armed and braced loses its strength
* But never hold back from firing the arrow if all that paralyses you is fear of making a mistake
* If you never take a risk, you will never know what changes you need to make
* In this lies the beauty of the way of the bow: you can never excuse yourself by saying that your opponent was stronger than you.
* That is why you must choose your target, do your best to hit it, and always regard it with respect and dignity; you need to know what it means and how much effort, training and intuition was required on your part
* Elegance is not the most comfortable of postures, but it is the best posture if the shot is to be perfect
* On a day when you are out of love with life, your aim will be confused, difficult
* And then comes the moment when he no longer has to think about what he is doing. From then on, the archer becomes his bow, his arrow and his target.
* The archer learns when he forgets all about the rules of the way of the bow and goes on to act entirely on instinct. In order, though, to be able to forget the rules, it is necessary to respect them and to know them.
* The way of the bow is the way of joy and enthusiasm, ofperfection and error, of technique and instinct.But you will only learn this if you keep shooting yourarrows.
* I need to remain focused and calm, to do the work I chose to do with love, and never to cling to the present moment, because death is still very close, the abyss is there beside me, and I am walking along the edge

Irrational Exuberance
*********************

*Robert J. Shiller*  (4294969191)

* In bubble times, there seems to be a tendency for complacency,
* herd behavior that can spread through millions or even billions of people,
* unsubstantiated belief systems, insubstantial wisps, do create bouts of irrational exuberance for significant periods of time, and these bouts ultimately drive the world economy.
* They see merciless capitalism as the wave of the future.
* If we exaggerate the present and future value of the stock market, then as a society we may invest too much in business start-ups and expansions, and too little in infrastructure, education, and other forms of human capita
* I marshal the most important insights offered by researchers in these fields. Taken as a whole, they suggest that the present stock market displays the classic features of a speculative bubble: a situation in which temporarily high prices are sustained largely by investors’ enthusiasm rather than by consistent estimation of real value. Under these conditions, even though the market could possibly maintain or even substantially increase its price level, the outlook for the stock market into the next ten or twenty years is likely to be rather poor—and perhaps even dangerous.
* If one tries too hard to be precise, one runs the risk of being so narrow as to be irrelevant
* news media’s constant attention to trivial factoids
* Most investors also seem to view the stock market as a force of nature unto itself
* Irrational exuberance is the psychological basis of a speculative bubble.
* between 1995 and 2000 the real stock market valuations of Brazil, France, China, and Germany roughly tripled, while that of the United Kingdom roughly doubled
* In 1999, the year before the peak, real stock price increases averaged 58% over the ten countries
* Real home prices for the United States as a whole increased 85% between 1997 and 2006.
* Reflections from casual observation ought to convince us that homes have not appreciated significantly over the decades
* owner-occupied housing is looking like a bad long-term investment relative to the stock market
* despite the occasional volatility of real estate, nationally it has offered practically no capital gains for long-term investors.

* You can free things from alien or accidental laws, but not from the laws of their own nature.… Do not go about … encouraging triangles to break out of the prison of their three sides. If a triangle breaks out of its three sides, its life comes to a lamentable end.
* The mechanics of recall can be complex. A common experience is that we know something is in our long-term memory—a word, a name, a face, an experience—but find ourselves unable to call it up. No matter how hard we try, the memory resists retrieval. But if we think sideways at it, recalling some slightly related or peripheral item, it often follows unbidden. (Human vision is also a little like this. When we look directly at a faint object—a star, say—we are using the fovea, the part of the retina with the greatest acuity and the greatest density of cells called cones. But when we avert our vision slightly—when, in a manner of speaking, we look sideways at the object—we bring into play the cells called rods, which are sensitive to feeble illumination and so able to perceive the faint star.) It would be interesting to know why thinking sideways improves memory retrieval; it may be merely associating to the memory trace by a different neural pathway. But it does

The Paradox of Choice
*********************

*Barry Schwartz*  (4294968817)

* On the other hand, the fact that some choice is good doesn’t necessarily mean that more choice is better. As I will demonstrate, there is a cost to having an overload of choice. As a culture, we are enamored of freedom, self-determination, and variety, and we are reluctant to give up any of our options. But clinging tenaciously to all the choices available to us contributes to bad decisions, to anxiety, stress, and dissatisfaction—even to clinical depression.
* Beauty used to be a gift bestowed upon the few for the rest of us to admire. Today it’s an achievement, and homeliness is not just misfortune but a failure.”
* Religious institutions then become a kind of market for comfort, tranquility, spirituality, and ethical reflection, and we “religion consumers” shop in that market until we find what we like.
* Nobel Prize–winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman and his colleagues have shown that what we remember about the pleasurable quality of our past experiences is almost entirely determined by two things: how the experiences felt when they were at their peak (best or worst), and how they felt when they ended. This “peak-end” rule of Kahneman’s is what we use to summarize the experience, and then we rely on that summary later to remind ourselves of how the experience felt.
* What often saves us from our faulty decision-making process is that different people experience different vivid or salient events, and thus have different events available to memory. You may have just read that Kias are actually very safe and you are all set to buy one. You mention this to me, but I’ve just read a story about a Kia being crushed by an SUV in an accident. So I tell you about my vivid memory, and that convinces you to revise your opinion. We are all susceptible to making errors, but we’re not each susceptible to making the same errors, because our experiences are different. As long as we include social interactions in our information gathering, and as long as our sources of information are diverse, we can probably steer clear of the worst pitfalls.
* It seems to be a fairly general principle that when making choices among alternatives that involve a certain amount of risk or uncertainty, we prefer a small, sure gain to a larger, uncertain one
* “law of diminishing marginal utility.” As the rich get richer, each additional unit of wealth satisfies them less.
* Aversion to losses also leads people to be sensitive to what are called “sunk costs.” Imagine having a $50 ticket to a basketball game being played an hour’s drive away. Just before the game there’s a big snowstorm—do you still want to go? Economists would tell us that the way to assess a situation like this is to think about the future, not the past. The $50 is already spent; it’s “sunk” and can’t be recovered. What matters is whether you’ll feel better safe and warm at home, watching the game on TV, or slogging through the snow on treacherous roads to see the game in person. That’s all that should matter. But it isn’t all that matters. To stay home is to incur a loss of $50, and people hate losses, so they drag themselves out to the game.
* Nobody has the time or cognitive resources to be completely thorough and accurate with every decision, and as more decisions are required and more options are available, the challenge of doing the decision making correctly becomes ever more difficult to meet.
* As options increase, the effort involved in making decisions increases, so mistakes hurt even more
* So we have to ask ourselves what counts when we assess the quality of a decision. Is it objective results or subjective experiences? What matters to us most of the time, I think, is how we feel about the decisions we make. When economists theorize about how consumers operate in the market, they assume that people seek to maximize their preferences, or their satisfaction. What becomes clear about “satisfaction” or “preferences” as they are experienced in real life is that they are subjective, not objective. Getting the best objective result may not be worth much if we feel disappointed with it anyway.

* Choice is what enables us to tell the world who we are and what we care about.

The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam
****************************

*Omar Khayyam*  (4294967596)

* There was a Door to which I found no Key:
* Tis all a Chequer-board of Nights and Days
* The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,
* Ah, with the Grape my fading Life provide,And wash my Body whence the life has died,And in a Windingsheet of Vineleaf wrapt,So bury me by some sweet Gardenside
* Indeed, the Idols I have loved so longHave done my Credit in Men's Eye much wrong:Have drown'd my Honour in a shallow Cup,And sold my Reputation for a Song.
* Indeed, indeed, Repentance oft beforeI swore—but was I sober when I swore?And then and then came Spring, and Rose-in-handMy thread-bare Penitence a-pieces tore.
* Alas, that Spring should vanish with the Rose!That Youth's sweet-scented Manuscript should close!The Nightingale that in the Branches sang,Ah, whence, and whither flown again, who knows!
* Ah, Love! could thou and I with Fate conspireTo grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,Would not we shatter it to bits—and thenRe-mould it nearer to the Heart's Desire!
* Whether at Naishapur or Babylon,Whether the Cup with sweet or bitter run,The Wine of Life keeps oozing drop by drop,The Leaves of Life keep falling one by one.
* A Book of Verses underneath the Bough,A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread—and ThouBeside me singing in the Wilderness—Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow!
* Ah, my Beloved, fill the Cup that clearsTO-DAY of past Regrets and future Fears:To-morrow—Why, To-morrow I may beMyself with Yesterday's Sev'n thousand Years.
* Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend,Before we too into the Dust descend;Dust into Dust, and under Dust to lie,Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer, and—sans End!
* There was the Door to which I found no Key;There was the Veil through which I might not see:Some little talk awhile of ME and THEEThere was—and then no more of THEE and ME.
* Perplext no more with Human or Divine,To-morrow's tangle to the winds resign,And lose your fingers in the tresses ofThe Cypress-slender Minister of Wine.

The Art of Concurrency
**********************

*Breshears, Clay*  (4294968491)

* A system is said to be concurrent if it can support two or more actions in progress at the same time. A system is said to be parallel if it can support two or more actions executing simultaneously. The key concept and difference between these definitions is the phrase “in progress.”
* A system is said to be concurrent if it can support two or more actions in progress at the same time. A system is said to be parallel if it can support two or more actions executing simultaneously. The key concept and difference between these definitions is the phrase “in progress.”
* The key concept and difference between these definitions is the phrase “in progress.”
* parallel” is a subset of “concurrent.
* In order to attain the maximum performance gains and keep your concurrent code as scalable as possible, the amount of work that is assigned to a thread must be large enough to minimize or mask the detrimental effects of overhead.
* debugging freshly written parallel code has two potential sources of problems: logic errors in the algorithm or implementation, and threading problems in the code.
* A thread-local storage (TLS) API is available in Windows threads and POSIX threads. Though the syntax is different in the different threaded libraries, the API allocates some memory per executing thread and allows the thread to store and retrieve a value that is accessible to only that thread. The difference between TLS and local declarations is that the TLS values will persist from one function call to another. This is much like static variables, except that in TLS, each thread gets an individually addressable copy.
* If you suspect a loop has independent iterations (those that can be run in any order), try executing the code with the loop iterations running in reverse of their original order. If the application still gets the same results, there is a strong chance that the iterations are independent and can be decomposed into task
* Once you have identified a portion of the serial code that can be executed concurrently, keep in mind the following two criteria for the actual decomposition into tasks:
* The granularity of a task must be large enough to render the task and thread management code a minuscule fraction of the overall parallel execution.
* Granularity, defined another way, is the amount of computation done before synchronization is needed.
* In static scheduling, the division of labor is known at the outset of the computation and doesn’t change during the computation. If at all possible, when developing your own concurrent code, try to use a static schedule.
* If you have a case where the amount of computation between tasks is variable and/or unpredictable, then you would be better served by using a dynamic scheduling scheme.
* The driving force behind the use of a dynamic schedule is to try to balance the load as evenly as possible between threads.

The Art of Stillness: Adventures in Going Nowhere
*************************************************

*Pico Iyer*  (4294968916)

* Going nowhere, as Leonard Cohen would later emphasize for me, isn’t about turning your back on the world; it’s about stepping away now and then so that you can see the world more clearly and love it more deeply
* it’s not our experiences that form us but the ways in which we respond to them
* It’s the perspective we choose—not the places we visit—that ultimately tells us where we stand.
* Heaven is the place where you think of nowhere else.
* “if you enter it with the set purpose of seeking contemplation, or, worse still, happiness, you will find neither. For neither can be found unless it is first in some sense renounced.”
* You don’t get over the shadows inside you simply by walking away from them.
* Half the confusion in the world comes from not knowing how little we need
* All the unhappiness of men,” the seventeenth-century French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal famously noted, “arises from one simple fact: that they cannot sit quietly in their chamber.
* people who seem wisest about the necessity of placing limits on the newest technologies are, often, precisely the ones who helped develop those technologies, which have bulldozed over so many of the limits of old.
* These days, in the age of movement and connection, space, as Marx had it in another context, has been annihilated by time; we feel as though we can make contact with almost anywhere at any moment. But as fast as geography is coming under our control, the clock is exerting more and more tyranny over us. And the more we can contact others, the more, it sometimes seems, we lose contact with ourselve
* Stillness has nothing to do with settledness or stasis.
* In an age of speed, I began to think, nothing could be more invigorating than going slow.
* In an age of distraction, nothing can feel more luxurious than paying attention
* And in an age of constant movement, nothing is more urgent than sitting still

* Naming a Slice
* Filtering Sequence Elements
* This is easily accomplished using a dictionary comprehension.  For example:
* replace() method of a namedtuple instance,
* Now suppose you want to perform lookups where you have to check both dictionaries (e.g., first checking in a and then in b if not found).   An easy way to do this is to use the ChainMap class from the collections module.  For example:
* re.split
* The format() function can also be used to easily align things.
* you never want to write code that joins strings together like this:
* Interpolating Variables in Strings
* Formatting Numbers for Output
* The problem here is that the value of x used in the lambda expression is a free variable that gets bound at runtime, not definition time.  Thus, the value of x in the lambda expressions is whatever the value of the x variable happens to be at the time of execution. For example:
* Accessing Variables Defined Inside a Closure
* Simply stated, a closure is just a function, but with an extra environment of the variables that are used inside the function.  A key feature of a closure is that it remembers the environment in which it was defined.

SuperFreakonomics

*Steven D. Levitt*  (4294968635)

* economist Joseph Schumpeter referred to capitalism as “creative destruction.”
* Behavior is driven by a much richer set of values and preferences.”
* Some people may feel uneasy about reducing the vagaries of human behavior to cold numerical probabilities
* These objections are good and true. But while there are exceptions to every rule, it’s also good to know the rule
* s of Palestinian suicide bombers by Claude Berrebi found that only 16 percent came from impoverished familie
* A similar analysis of Palestinian suicide bombers by Claude Berrebi found that only 16 percent came from impoverished families, versus more than 30 percent of male Palestinians overall. More than 60 percent of the bombers, meanwhile, had gone beyond high school, versus 15 percent of the populace.
* crime is primarily driven by personal gain, whereas terrorism is fundamentally a political act. In his analysis, the kind of person most likely to become a terrorist is similar to the kind of person most likely to…vote. Think of terrorism as civic passion on steroids.
* But a revolutionary and a terrorist have different goals. Revolutionaries want to overthrow and replace a government. Terrorists want to—well, it isn’t always clear. As one sociologist puts it, they might wish to remake the world in their own dystopian image; religious terrorists may want to cripple the secular institutions they despise. Krueger cites more than one hundred different scholarly definitions of terrorism. “At a conference in 2002,” he writes, “foreign ministers from over 50 Islamic states agreed to condemn terrorism but could not agree on a definition of what it was that they had condemned.”
* Terrorism is effective because it imposes costs on everyone, not just its direct victims. The most substantial of these indirect costs is fear of a future attack, even though such fear is grossly misplaced. The probability that an average American will die in a given year from a terrorist attack is roughly 1 in 5 million; he is 575 times more likely to commit suicide.
* a person using a computer experiences “cognitive drift” if more than one second elapses between clicking the mouse and seeing new data on the screen. If ten seconds pass, the person’s mind is somewhere else entire
* More than thirty-five years later, the horror lived on in The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell’s groundbreaking book about social behavior, as an example of the “bystander effect,” whereby the presence of multiple witnesses at a tragedy can actually inhibit intervention.
* Even the “locavore” movement, which encourages people to eat locally grown food, doesn’t help in this regard. A recent study by two Carnegie Mellon researchers, Christopher Weber and H. Scott Matthews, found that buying locally produced food actually increases greenhouse-gas emissions. Why?
* Modern technology is so proficient that it often masks the costs associated with our consumption.

* What makes a good marriage is not simply “chemistry” but how the partners handle conflict.
* Thing that “don’t add up” like this indicate a divided personality
* A conflict involves inconsistencies to which the person is generally blind. For example:
* blind rebellion, blind craving to excel, and a blind need to keep away from others are all forms of dependence.”
* Its insight was that it is a mistake to pursue happiness itself. Rather, we should recognize when we are genuinely happy—what we are doing when we feel powerful and “true”—and do more of those things.
* the common idea of a creative individual coming up with great insights, discoveries, works, or inventions in isolation is wrong.
* Creativity results from a complex interaction between a person and their environment or culture, and also depends on timing.
* Truly creative people work for work’s own sake, and if they make a public discovery or become famous that is a bonus.
* What drives them, more than rewards, is the desire to find or create order where there was none before.
* In short, to do new things, you first have to have done the old things well.
* To be a powerfully creative adult, it is best to be brought up in a family that values intellectual endeavor, not one that celebrates middle-class comfort.
* he creative are both humble and proud, with a selfless devotion to their domain and what might be achieved, yet also confidence that they have much to contribute and will make their mark.

The Complete Story of Civilization
**********************************

*Will Durant*  (4294969101)

* CIVILIZATION is social order promoting cultural creation.
* Four elements constitute it: economic provision, political organization, moral traditions, and the pursuit of knowledge and the arts
* The first form of culture is agriculture.
* Culture suggests agriculture, but civilization suggests the city
* Civilization begins in the peasant’s hut, but it comes to flower only in the towns
* Through church, or family, or school, or otherwise, there must be a unifying moral code,
* some rules of the game of life acknowledged even by those who violate them, and giving to conduct some order and regularity, some direction and stimulus
* calling other human beings “savage” or “barbarous” we may be expressing no objective fact, but only our fierce fondness for ourselves, and our timid shyness in the presence of alien way
* The moment man begins to take thought of the morrow he passes out of the Garden of Eden into the vale of anxiety;
* We must respect one another’s delusions
* If man began with speech, and civilization with agriculture, industry began with fire.
* most history is guessing, and the rest is prejudice

Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle
**********************************************

*C. G. Jung*  (4294969177)

* The discoveries of modern physics have, as we know, brought about a significant change in our scientific picture of the world, in that they have shattered the absolute validity of natural law and made it relative. Natural laws are statistical truths, which means that they are completely valid only when we are dealing with rnacrophysical quantities. In the realm of very small quantities prediction becomes uncertain, if not impossible, because very small quantities no longer behave in accordance with the known natural laws.
* Moreover, the experiment imposes limiting conditions on nature, for its aim is to force her to give answers to questions devised by man. Every answer of nature is therefore more or less influenced by the kind of questions asked, and the result is always a hybrid product.
* Chance, we say, must obviously be susceptible of some causal explanation and is only called “chance” or “coincidence” because its causality has not yet been discovered
* The suspicion that this must be a case of meaningful coincidence, i.e., an acausal connection, is very natural. I must own that this run of events made a considerable impression on me. It seemed to me to have a certain numinous quality.11 In such circumstances we are inclined to say, “That cannot be mere chance,” without knowing what exactly we are saying. Kammerer would no doubt have reminded me of his “seriality.” The strength of an impression, however, proves nothing against the fortuitous coincidence of all these fishes. It is, admittedly, exceedingly odd that the fish theme recurs no less than six times within twenty-four hours. But one must remember that fish on Friday is the usual thing, and on April 1 one might very easily think of the April fish. I had at that time been working on the fish symbol for several months. Fishes frequently occur as symbols of unconscious contents. So there is no possible justification for seeing in this anything but a chance grouping. Runs or series which are composed of quite ordinary occurrences must for the present be regarded as fortuitous.12 However wide their range may be, they must be ruled out as acausal connections. It is, therefore, generally assumed that all coincidences are lucky hits and do not require an acausal interpretation.13 This assumption can, and indeed must, be regarded as true so long as proof is lacking that their incidence exceeds the limits of probability. Should this proof be forthcoming, however, it would prove at the same time that there are genuinely non-causal combinations of events for whose explanation we should have to postulate a factor incommensurable with causality. We should then have to assume that events in general are related to one another on the one hand as causal chains, and on the other hand by a kind of meaningful cross-connection.
* Primitive superstition lies just below the surface of even the most tough-minded individuals, and it is precisely those who most fight against it who are the first to succumb to its suggestive effects.
* Space and time, the conceptual coordinates of bodies in motion, are probably at bottom one and the same (which is why we speak of a long or short “space of time”),
* causality is bound up with the existence of space and time and physical changes, and consists essentially in the succession of cause and effect.
* But a “cause” can only be a demonstrable quantity.
* A “transcendental cause” is a contradiction in terms, because anything transcendental cannot by definition be demonstrated.
* Naturally every age thinks that all ages before it were prejudiced, and today we think this more than ever and are just as wrong as all previous ages that thought so.
* It is sad but unfortunately true that man learns nothing from history.
* Unlike the Greek-trained Western mind, the Chinese mind does not aim at grasping details for their own sake, but at a view which sees the detail as part of a whole.

Seven Concurrency Models in Seven Weeks
***************************************

*Paul Butcher*  (4294969185)

* A concurrent program has multiple logical threads of control. These threads may or may not run in parallel.
* A parallel program potentially runs more quickly than a sequential program by executing different parts of the computation simultaneously (in parallel). It may or may not have more than one logical thread of control.
* If you’re working on a genuinely concurrent problem, nondeterminism is natural and to be expected.
* Parallelism, by contrast, doesn’t necessarily imply nondeterminism
* Concurrency enables resilient, or fault-tolerant, software through independence and fault detection. Independence is important because a failure in one task should not be able to bring down another. And fault detection is critical so that when a task fails (because it crashes or becomes unresponsive, or because the hardware it’s running on dies), a separate task is notified so that it can take remedial action.
* Deadlock is a danger whenever a thread tries to hold more than one lock
* there is a simple rule that guarantees  you will never deadlock—always acquire locks in a fixed, global order.
* The only solution is to avoid calling alien methods while holding a lock. One way to achieve this is to make a defensive copy of listeners before iterating through it:
* the three primary perils of threads and locks—race conditions, deadlock, and memory visibility,
* some rules that help us avoid them:                      Synchronize all access to shared variables.                          Both the writing and the reading threads need to use synchronization
* Having said that, a good rule of thumb is that for computation-intensive tasks, you probably want to have approximately the same number of threads as available cores. Larger numbers are appropriate for IO-intensive tasks.
* Beyond this rule of thumb, your best bet is to create a realistic load test and break out the stopwatch.

The Global Food Economy
***********************

*Weis, Tony*  (4294969356)

* the UN World Food Programme suggests that the volume of food produced is more than one and a half times what is needed to provide every person on earth with a nutritious diet
* Globally, the population of obese people now actually outnumbers the population of the undernourished.
* Globally, the rise and spread of processed and pre-prepared meals have implicitly served to undermine the cultural significance of food preparation and consumption, while the marketing efforts of agro-food TNCs in many parts of the world have explicitly aimed to ‘downgrade not only local diets per se but also the symbolic value of traditional foods … as culturally inferior
* Thirty crops now essentially feed the world, providing 95 per cent of humanity’s plant-based calorific and protein intake.
* As many as seven thousand plant species have been cultivated or collected for food in human history, but this diversity is shrinking precipitously. There was a drastic decline in both the diversity of crop species planted in agricultural systems and the genetic diversity within species (called ‘genetic erosion’) during the twentieth century, with these declines as great as 75 to 90 per cent according to FAO estimates. Thirty crops now essentially feed the world, providing 95 per cent of humanity’s plant-based calorific and protein intake. The world’s top ten crops (rice, wheat, maize, soybeans, sorghum, millet, potatoes, sweet potatoes, sugar cane/beet and bananas) supply over three-quarters of humanity’s plant-based calories and dominate the world’s cultivated lands, and the ‘big three’ cereals alone (rice, wheat and maize) account for more than half of all plant-based calories and 85 per cent of the total volume of world grains produced (FAOSTAT; FAO 1997). Though the growth of soybeans (an oilseed) has been spatially concentrated in the USA, Brazil, Argentina and China, its scale and central role in the industrial fusion of grain and livestock sectors is such that it is now part of a ‘big four’ of global crop production. Soybean cake, the hardened mass after the oil has been pressed, provides a protein-intensive feedstock, and this now comprises almost two-thirds of the world’s protein feed given to livestock (Ridgeway 2004). Since the 1970s, soybeans have had the fastest growth in land space of any crop, and it is expected that their per capita production will continue to advance over cereals given their key role as livestock feed (FAO 2002a). Between 1990 and 2005 alone, global soybean production roughly doubled.
* While the human population has more than doubled since 1950, meat production grew nearly fivefold by volume
* The 20 per cent of the world’s population living in the world’s richest countries consume about 40 per cent of all meat,
* In 2005, China consumed more meat than did the world’s entire human population in 1961
* Soybean exporting has more than doubled since 1990, dominated almost exclusively by the USA and Brazil
* The essential argument of the free market approach to food security is that a nation should concentrate its productive resources on those sectors, agricultural or otherwise, where it has a comparative advantage to maximize the generation of foreign exchange, and open its markets in order to import goods that are produced more cheaply elsewhere
* George Bush Sr’s famous remark to the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 that ‘the American lifestyle is not up for negotiation’, which was echoed a decade later by his son’s attempt to explain the US refusal to sign the Kyoto Accord: ‘We will not do anything that harms our economy, because first things first are the people who live in America. That’s my priority.
* Thatcher’s famous claim that ‘there is no alternative’ to capitalist market integration and the dominance of large corporations within the global economy

Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow
*******************************

*Jerome Klapka Jerome*  (4294967316)

* Yes, it is the brightness, not the darkness, that we see when we look back. The sunshine casts no shadows on the past. The road that we have traversed stretches very fair behind us. We see not the sharp stones. We dwell but on the roses by the wayside, and the strong briers that stung us are, to our distant eyes, but gentle tendrils waving in the wind.
* There is no returning on the road of life. The frail bridge of time on which we tread sinks back into eternity at every step we take. The past is gone from us forever. It is gathered in and garnered. It belongs to us no more. No single word can ever be unspoken; no single step retraced. Therefore it beseems us as true knights to prick on bravely, not idly weep because we cannot now recall.
* Not that the past should be buried. The music of life would be mute if the chords of memory were snapped asunder. It is but the poisonous weeds, not the flowers, that we should root out from the garden of Mnemosyne.
* Cupid spends no second arrow on the same heart
* It is a cheerless hour for you both when the lamp of love has gone out and the fire of affection is not yet lit, and you have to grope about in the cold, raw dawn of life to kindle it. God grant it catches light before the day is too far spent. Many sit shivering by the dead coals till night come
* We do not hate, nor grieve, nor joy, nor despair in our thirties like we did in our teens
* A boy's love comes from a full heart; a man's is more often the result of a full stomach
* Ah, those foolish days, those foolish days when we were unselfish and pure-minded; those foolish days when our simple hearts were full of truth, and faith, and reverence! Ah, those foolish days of noble longings and of noble strivings! And oh, these wise, clever days when we know that money is the only prize worth striving for, when we believe in nothing else but meanness and lies, when we care for no living creature but ourselves!
* Chivalry is not dead: it only sleeps for want of work to do
* Memory; nothing that she brings to us is complete. She is a willful child; all her toys are broken
* Even the sadness that is past seems sweet.

The God delusion
****************

*Richard Dawkins*  (4294967719)

* when two opposite points of view are expressed with equal force, the truth does not necessarily lie midway between them. It is possible for one side to be simply wrong. And that justifies passion on the other side.
* no one thing is the root of all anything.
* When one person suffers from a delusion, it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called Religion.’
* The religion of one age is theliterary entertainment of the next.
* Ridicule is the only weapon which can be used against unintelligible propositions. Ideas must be distinct before reason can act upon them; and no man ever had a distinct idea of the trinity. It is the mere Abracadabra of the mountebanks calling themselves the priests of Jesus.’
* Life is too short to bother with the distinction between one figment of the imagination and many.
* Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time.
* Some questions simply do not deserve an answer. What is the colour of abstraction? What is the smell of hope? The fact that a question can be phrased in a grammatically correct English sentence doesn’t make it meaningful, or entitle it to our serious attention. Nor, even if the question is a real one, does the fact that science cannot answer it imply that religion can.
* definition of the verb ‘to pray’: ‘to ask that the laws of the universe be annulled in behalf of a single petitioner, confessedly unworthy
* We have names for people who have many beliefs for which there is no rational justification. When their beliefs are extremely common we call them ‘religious’; otherwise, they are likely to be called ‘mad’, ‘psychotic’ or ‘delusional’…Clearly there is sanity in numbers. And yet, it is merely an accident of history that it is considered normal in our society to believe that the Creator of the universe can hear your thoughts, while it is demonstrative of mental illness to believe that he is communicating with you by having the rain tap in Morse code on your bedroom window. And so, while religious people are not generally mad, their core beliefs absolutely are.
* Constructing models is something the human brain is very good at. When we are asleep it is called dreaming; when we are awake we call it imagination or, when it is exceptionally vivid, hallucination

Mastering Massive Complexity: Inside the Gong Dao Bei, the Path to Transformation
*********************************************************************************

*Don Johnson*  (4294969368)

* One wonders where many of the much-touted benefits of our modern technologies are so thoroughly hidden. And as for the ancients, were their lives really so simple after all?
* And emotions, like love, trust, hate, and anger—the most relevant and essential phenomena—can only be measured indirectly by their effects, whether transformative or insidiously destructive.
* This same absurd daisy chain of goofiness is symptomatic of the many not-so-creative kludges, confused decisions, and bizarre forced fixes that we engage in on a daily basis in our seemingly interconnected and interdependent high-tech work environments. How can it be? After all, we also mean well.
* Many of these insidious gaps exist precisely at critical interface and transition points where human beings have to make rapid handoffs and key decisions that have unseen, global impact across the enterprise, regulatory entities, strategic partners, and the extended supply chain.
* in their effort to deal with it and accomplish their actual task on time, they resort to creative kludges in a sincere effort to try to deal with the awkwardness—in essence, they’re slurping spiders

What's It All About?: Philosophy and the Meaning of Life
********************************************************

*Julian Baggini*  (4294967518)

* The universe may have a purpose, but nothing we  know suggests that, if so, this purpose has any similarity to ours.'
* It is not that life has  no meaning, but that it has no predetermined meaning
* what matters  is not necessarily what the inventor had in mind, but the uses or  purposes the innovation actually has.
* life which is lived only in  the present is inherently unsatisfactory, for the very reason that the  moment always eludes us
* Nevertheless, Kierkegaard's analysis of the human condition can  illuminate the problem of the goal-orientated life. The difficulty  such a life faces is that it locates the purpose of life in the  achievement of the goal, which is necessarily tied to a discrete  moment in time. This reflects the aesthetic nature of human life.  We are tied to the present and we must expect some of life's  meaning to reflect that. But we also exist across time, and when our  life's goals are fixed so narrowly on moments that are only briefly  the present, we fail to do justice to the enduring aspect of human  life.
* The person who sacrifices too much enjoyment of life to serve  the purpose of future wealth and security is thus making the mistake  of overestimating the extent to which his future life will be better  than the one he could have now
* The risk is not only that the future won't be good enough to  justify the past, but also that the future will never come
* . If we think that a life without any difficulties and worries lies  in the future we are mistaken. We need to recognize the fragility of  good fortune and the impermanence of things. But do we have the  courage and honesty to take life for what it is and make the most  of it? Or do we fear that if we do so it will prove to be a  disappointment?
* Faith, then, has to be seen in contrast to reason or else it loses its  distinctive character.

Seven Databases in Seven Weeks (for Greg Kennedy)
*************************************************

*Eric Redmond*  (4294967401)

* Joining, in essence, is an operation taking two separate tables and combining them in some way to return a single table.
* Outer joins are a way of merging two tables when the results of one table must always be returned, whether or not any matching column values exist on the other table.
* solves a surprising number of problems if you swing hard enough
* Creating a table consists of giving it a name and a list of columns with types and (optional) constraint information. Each table should also nominate a unique identifier column to pinpoint specific rows. That identifier is called a PRIMARY KEY.  The SQL to create a countries table looks like this:
* With only real countries left in the countries table, let’s add a cities table. To ensure any inserted country_code also exists in our countries table, we add the REFERENCES keyword. Since the country_code column references another table’s key, it’s known as the foreign key constraint.
* Rather than delete and reinsert the value, we can update it inline.
* This time, we constrained the name in cities by disallowing NULL values. We constrained postal_code by checking that no values are empty strings (<> means not equal).          Furthermore, since a PRIMARY KEY uniquely identifies a row, we created a compound key: country_code + postal_code. Together, they uniquely define a row.

97 Things Every Programmer Should Know

*Kevlin Henney*  (4294967625)

* Once             you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the             truth,
* Coding by the old adage, "If it was hard to write, it             should be hard to read," does a disservice to your client, your employer, your             colleagues, and your future self.
* Comments should say something code does not and cannot             say
* Don't be afraid of your code. Who cares if something gets temporarily broken            while you move things around? A paralyzing fear of change is what got your project into            this state
* Don't Rely on "Magic Happens Here"
* DRY requires that "every piece of knowledge must have a             single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."
* Wittgenstein also shows that our ability to understand one another at all             does not arise from shared definitions, it arises from a shared experience, from a form             of life.

Python Web Development with Django®

*Jeff Forcier*  (4294967778)

* There is a third sequence type called tuples. They can most easily be described as “handicapped read-only lists” because they don’t seem like more than that—they serve a very different purpose. They are not going to be your first choice as an application data structure, but we do need to tell you what they are and what they’re used for. Because you probably already know what a string is, we’ll start with lists first and cover tuples last. Table 1.2 itemizes each sequence type we discuss and gives some examples.
* Generator Expressions
* specifying lists or dicts as default arguments can be very dangerous, as they persist across multiple function call
* Python code is made up of both expressions and statements which are executed by the Python interpreter. The major difference is an expression has a value; its result is always a Python object. When evaluated by the Python interpreter, it results in some object, any object; for example, 42, 1 + 2, int(’123’), range(10), and so forth.

* Now that your staging area is set up the way you want it, you can commit your changes. Remember that anything that is still unstaged - any files you have created or modified that you haven't run git add on since you edited them - won't go into this commit. They will stay as modified files on your disk. In this case, the last time you ran git status, you saw that everything was staged, so you're ready to commit your changes. The simplest way to commit is to type git commit:
* The most interesting option is format, which allows you to specify your own log output format. This is especially useful when you're generating output for machine parsing - because you specify the format explicitly, you know it won't change with updates to Git:

Free Will
*********

*Sam Harris*  (4294968190)

* Honestly, I cannot understand what people mean when they talk about the freedom of the human will. I have a feeling, for instance, that I will something or other; but what relation this has with freedom I cannot understand at all. I feel that I will to light my pipe and I do it; but how can I connect this up with the idea of freedom? What is behind the act of willing to light the pipe? Another act of willing? Schopenhauer once said: Der Mensch kann was er will; er kann aber nicht wollen was er will (Man can do what he will but he cannot will what he wills). (M. Planck, 1932. Where is science going? New York: W. W. Norton & Company, p. 201.)
* It is one thing to bicker with your wife because you are in a bad mood; it is another to realize that your mood and behavior have been caused by low blood sugar. This understanding reveals you to be a biochemical puppet, of course, but it also allows you to grab hold of one of your strings: A bite of food may be all that your personality requires
* In fact, it seems immoral not to recognize just how much luck is involved in morality itself.
* The urge for retribution depends upon our not seeing the underlying causes of human behavior.
* For most purposes, it makes sense to ignore the deep causes of desires and intentions—genes, synaptic potentials, etc.—and focus instead on the conventional outlines of the person. We do this when thinking about our own choices and behaviors—because it’s the easiest way to organize our thoughts and actions. Why did I order beer instead of wine? Because I prefer beer. Why do I prefer it? I don’t know, but I generally have no need to ask. Knowing that I like beer more than wine is all I need to know to function in a restaurant. Whatever the reason, I prefer one taste to the other. Is there freedom in this? None whatsoever. Would I magically reclaim my freedom if I decided to spite my preference and order wine instead? No, because the roots of this intention would be as obscure as the preference itself.

The Language Hoax: Why the World Looks the Same in Any Language
***************************************************************

*John H. McWhorter*  (4294968617)

* Sapir-Whorf hypothesis—Ed
* It is easy to suppose that one of the most interesting things about language is that people whose languages assign genders to inanimate objects perceive those objects as meaningfully more male or female than speakers of English
* To be sure, both Deutscher’s and Everett’s books actually argue that language’s effect on thought is modest, hedging the issue as responsibly as we would expect of academics. Both are well aware that the classic formulation of Whorfianism is hopeless. Everett’s point is, in fact, more that culture can shape language—essentially an extension of the hotel cat phenomenon—than the other way around. By the end of his book, Deutscher even spells out that “Color may be the area that comes closest in reality to the metaphor of language as a lens,”—italics mine—making clear that overall, evidence for “language as a lens” has been elusive. Through the Language Glass is so thorough in outlining both the failure of early Whorfianism and the deeply modest results of Neo-Whorfianism that it is, in essence, a gorgeously written chronicle of an idea that didn’t pan out. Truly gorgeous: the prose is the written equivalent to foie gras or, if that’s not up your alley, key lime pie.
* Under Whorfianism, everybody is interesting and everybody matters.
* Not that the louder noise is even a crude one. Even Whorfianism’s biggest fans regularly disown the old-time “Hopi” version. It is typical—seemingly almost required—to quote founding linguist Roman Jakobson, whose verdict was that “languages differ essentially in what they must convey and not in what they may convey.” The insight is that languages do not saddle speakers with blinders preventing them from perceiving what their vocabularies and grammars happen not to call attention to. Yes, one language forces one to speak gender, such as English with he and she; many languages have one word that covers both men and women. Yes, another one forces one to speak social hierarchy, such as Thai and all of those ways of saying you, or even European languages like French with the difference between familiar tu and formal vous. Yet, one can say anything in any language. Even people new to the topic often come up with this basic insight on their own.
* Nominally we are fascinated by a question as to whether language influences thought in a significant way. However, in the way the question is framed and reported on, there reigns a tacit assumption th

From the point of view of morality, it is not important that everyone should have the same. What is morally important is that each should have enough. If everyone had enough money, it would be of no special or deliberate concern whether some people had more money than others.

* People tend to favor information that confirms their existing beliefs.

Dice World
**********

*Clegg, Brian*  (4294967879)

* Once you get beyond basic bodily functions and activities, the vast majority of our time in the modern world is spent doing things that the human body did not evolve to do
* In science we are looking for patterns and rules to explain what the universe and its components do and how they do it. It’s as simple as that. The mechanisms modern scientists use may get heavy-duty and scarily mathematical, but the basic principle is still one of looking for patterns. What scientists do is arguably just a simple and rather beautiful formalisation of our natural approach to exploring the unknown.
* What we’ve got is correlation without causality. Just because two things happen in a similar location or at a similar time doesn’t mean that one causes the other. Superstition turns a correlation (events that happen at a similar time or place) into a false cause.

The Poincare Conjecture
***********************

*Donal O'Shea*  (4294968019)

* Another crucial thing to keep in mind is the use of the word dimension. In the casual usage of everyday speech, one will often hear assertions such as the Earth (or a sphere) or a torus is three-dimensional             because one needs a three-dimensional space in which to fully fit it. We will never use dimension in this way. For us, dimension refers to the number of independent directions needed to represent all points on an object near a given point. If we tried             to put all the maps in an atlas together to get a sort of globe that represented the surface more holistically, we will certainly             need a third dimension (or more), but we still refer to the manifold or surface as being two-dimensional. The dimension refers             to the number of independent directions that someone who lived on the manifold would experience, not the number of dimensions             that we need to fit the object into.20 So, the surface of the Earth is two-dimensional because, to represent a region of it, we use a map on a piece of paper (or,             equivalently, we can use two numbers, such as latitude and longitude, to represent any point near a fixed point). A plane             is two-dimensional, but any line, whether or not it is curved (and, in particular, a circle), is one-dimensional. The space             in which our world exists (that is, our universe) is three-dimensional, as is the region beneath the surface (that is, the             bedrock and magma) of the Earth. Later, we shall return to the notion of dimension, defining it even more carefully and reducing             it to numbers. It will turn out that there will be manifolds of any dimension.
* One common misconception is that for an object to be finite, it must have a boundary
* Two manifolds that are the same topologically are also said to be homeomorphic, and the one-to-one correspondence that establishes that they are the same is called a homeomorphism

* The mortgage is the neutron bomb of financial products.”

* Because highly rated securitized tranches required less capital, it made more sense for financial institutions to hold the securities rather than the original loans

Infinity and the Mind
*********************

*Rucker, Rudy*  (4294968218)

* The point of this question is that one is often pressured to feel that the concerns of society or the world are more significant than one’s own immediate personal concerns. But this is based on the assumption that some sizes are in an absolute sense bigger than others, and it is this assumption that circular scale undermines.
* We should not be too hasty in assuming that every property of the abstract mathematical space we use to organize our experiences is an actual property of the concrete physical space we live in
* Aristotle maintained that “what is limited, is not limited in reference to something that surrounds it.

Complexity: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)
****************************************************************

*John H. Holland*  (4294968956)

* At the outset, it is helpful to distinguish complex from complicated. The dictionary is not helpful in making this distinction, treating the terms as almost synonymous and emphasizing ‘interconnected parts’ in both cases. Moreover, distinguishing complex from complicated involves the ‘pile of sand’ conundrum. If we start with a recognizable pile of sand and start taking away one grain at a time, when does it cease to be a pile of sand? At some point, the pile of sand will disappear and most will see only scattered grains of sand, but there is no sharp boundary at which this happens. Complicated and complex similarly defy any attempt to provide a sharp, distinguishing demarcation—it is easy to distinguish one from the other at the extremes but there is a middle-ground where the distinction becomes unclear and arbitrary.
* It was discovered that minute differences in initial conditions for the weather equations could lead to later outcomes so different that they appear random relative to the starting point.

* In general terms, the Weber-Fechner law states that there is a constant ratio between the magnitude of a stimulus (for example, sound, light, muscular work, and so on) and the change in that stimulus that is needed for a person to notice a difference. In practical terms, what this means is that the greater the magnitude or intensity of a stimulus, the greater is the change needed in order for us to notice a difference; or conversely, as the intensity of the stimulus decreases, the order of change needed to notice a difference becomes smaller and smaller.

Alternately, you may wish to create a quick-reference guide containing the tips from this manual that apply to your particular situation.  For example, if you recommend that people use setup.py develop when tracking your in-development code, you should let them know that this needs to be run after every update or commit.
* Similarly, if you remove modules or data files from your project, you should remind them to run setup.py clean --all and delete any obsolete .pyc or .pyo.  (This tip applies to the distutils in general, not just setuptools, but not everybody knows about them; be kind to your users by spelling out your project’s best practices rather than leaving them guessing.)

Can an eight-hour-a-day employee be more productive than a twelve-hour-a-day employee? You know the answers. What really matters is results—not check marks—and not hours. Busyness doesn’t necessarily equal productivity, no matter how you slice it. No one really cares how many hours you were in the building or if you finished your to-do list. People only care about what you’re able to produce and the value of those results.

What I thought was just a flippant and cynical comment would later help to define my understanding of dysfunctional romantic relationships. I would never have guessed that my dad’s off-the-cuff remark would contain so much psychological merit. Perhaps he understood that the initial wondrous feelings of joy and euphoria would never last. It would inevitably transform into something more insidiously harmful, and the sweetheart of our dreams would end up as a “ball and chain” locked around our ankle for the rest of our lives.

*Locke, Robert R., Spender, J.-C.*  (4294969316)

* This was a moment of profound failure of academic leadership, for the objective market forces to which these neoliberal economists appealed were not of this world. No one leading a school of general medicine will stop students from learning the practice of surgery simply because cutting the human body cannot be reduced to rigorous theory. Practical education calls for a fruitful balance of theoretical instruction and carefully guided practical experience, just as German engineering studies successfully developed and implemented Technik – the blending of scientific theory with workshop knowhow that is the traditional German definition of useful engineering. That US business schools failed – in part through greed, in part through the genuine difficulty of it – to develop a satisfactory way to balance abstract theorizing with a practical sense of community service and engagement is a sign of this leadership collapse. The US business schools have generally ignored the many years of experimentation in practical and professional education – in Germany, the UK, and elsewhere – even as the latter offer good evidence of the benefits of educational balance for the former to study and, perhaps, emulate. We live with the consequences.

* In the “laws of thought” approach to AI, the emphasis was on correct inferences. Making correct inferences is sometimes part of being a rational agent, because one way to act rationally is to reason logically to the conclusion that a given action will achieve one’s goals and then to act on that conclusion. On the other hand, correct inference is not all of rationality; in some situations, there is no provably correct thing to do, but something must still be done. There are also ways of acting rationally that cannot be said to involve inference. For example, recoiling from a hot stove is a reflex action that is usually more successful than a slower action taken after careful deliberation.
